<p>The accent color for editorials &amp; about pages.</p>

<p>Similar to the <a href="/about/color-d34b6c/">default color</a> <code>#d34b6c</code>, color <code>#bada55</code> is another fact, not an easter egg. The only thing that gives it 🥚 potential is that it can be read as <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/badass">‘badass’.</a></p>
<p>There is even a site named bada55.io<sup><a id="ref-fn-1" href="#fn-1" role="doc-noteref" aria-label="Footnote #1">[1]</a></sup>, and since we are already at the topic of color hex values that spell something, let me tell you that …</p>

<p>I really like <code>#c0ffee</code>. ☕</p>

<p>Back to <code>#bada55</code>, which not only plays a role here as the accent color for editorial blog posts and about pages, it also happens to be the dominant color on <a href="https://cv.cssence.com/">my résumé.</a> (Perhaps I thought I’m a CSS badass.)</p>
<p>The name of the color is <a href="https://www.color-name.com/hex/bada55">‘June Bud’,</a> which 1. makes it more adorable (unlike the badass thing), and 2. is something I’ve learned while writing this text. Personally, I liked the color since I first saw it. Having already used it on my résumé subdomain made it a contender when I came up with <a href="/2024/accentcolor-accentcolortext/">accent colors</a> for the sections of this site, which happened a long time ago. Hardly a surprise it ended up being used for editorial blog posts and about pages, because those tell you more of a personal story, like my résumé does.</p>
