<h1>Color #bada55</h1>
<p>The accent color for editorials &amp; about pages.</p>
<p><i>Easter egg</i><br><time>2025-03-21T06:07:00Z</time></p>

<p>Similar to the <a href="/about/color-d34b6c/">default color</a> <code>#d34b6c</code>, color <code>#bada55</code> is another fact, not an easter egg. The only thing that gives it ðŸ¥š potential is that it can be read as <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/badass">â€˜badassâ€™.</a></p>
<p>There is even a site named bada55.io<sup><a id="ref-fn-1" href="#fn-1" role="doc-noteref" aria-label="Footnote #1">[1]</a></sup>, and since we are already at the topic of color hex values that spell something, let me tell you that â€¦</p>

<p>I really like <code>#c0ffee</code>. â˜•</p>

<p>Back to <code>#bada55</code>, which not only plays a role here as the accent color for editorial blog posts and about pages, it also happens to be the dominant color on <a href="https://cv.cssence.com/">my rÃ©sumÃ©.</a> (Perhaps I thought Iâ€™m a CSS badass.)</p>
<p>The name of the color is <a href="https://www.color-name.com/hex/bada55">â€˜June Budâ€™,</a> which 1. makes it more adorable (unlike the badass thing), and 2. is something Iâ€™ve learned while writing this text. Personally, I liked the color when I first saw it. Having already used it on my rÃ©sumÃ© subdomain made it a contender when I came up with <a href="/2024/accentcolor-accentcolortext/">accent colors</a> for the sections of this site, which happened a long time ago. Hardly a surprise it ended up being used for editorial blog posts and about pages, because those tell you more of a personal story, like my rÃ©sumÃ© does.<sup><a id="ref-fn-2" href="#fn-2" role="doc-noteref" aria-label="Footnote #2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a id="ref-fn-3" href="#fn-3" role="doc-noteref" aria-label="Footnote #3">[3]</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="fns">Footnotes</h2>
<ol>
<li id="fn-1">I didnâ€™t add a link to bada55.io, because of some questionable content, but more importantly because it appears to be insecure. Lack of https is not an option in 2024. <a href="#ref-fn-1" role="doc-backlink" aria-label="Back to article">â†©ï¸Ž</a></li>
<li id="fn-2">With the introduction of <a href="/2022/dark-mode-color-palette/">dark mode,</a> things got more complicated. If you prefer a dark color scheme, you may never encounter <code>#bada55</code> on this site. <a href="#ref-fn-2" role="doc-backlink" aria-label="Back to article">â†©ï¸Ž</a></li>
<li id="fn-3">The new <em>Elegant Style</em> (see Settings page) does not distingiush between blog post types, <code>#d34b6c</code>is the only accent color. So when it becomes the default, the color wonâ€™t play a role anymore. <a href="#ref-fn-3" role="doc-backlink" aria-label="Back to article">â†©ï¸Ž</a></li>
