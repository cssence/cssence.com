<p>Colors have been used on this site to distingiush between blog post types for quite some time. But do these accent colors have Easter egg potential? Letâ€™s find out by looking at the two most important colors.</p>
<h2>Color #d34b6c</h2>
<p>The quintessential color is the default accent color <code>#d34b6c</code>. According to this siteâ€™s <a href="/about/">about page</a>, â€¦</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[the] color became the default when switching to a flat design in 2014.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I donâ€™t remember how I ended up with this color. I know the â€˜whyâ€™, it was because back then I switched my logo from PNG to SVG, and I needed a single color for the fill of the 45Â°&nbsp;bar.</p>
<figure class="standoff" style="--offset:-6rem"><img src="/about/logo.png" alt="Logo of CSSence.com with the default accent color.">
<figcaption>The 45Â°&nbsp;bar, i.e. the part that turns the â€˜câ€™ into an â€˜eâ€™, has color <code>#d34b6c</code> as its default for more than ten years now.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It still begs the question why I needed a color other than the one I already had in place: If you look at the thumbnail image of this ancient <a href="/2012/goodbye-wordpress/">Â»Goodbye WordPressÂ«</a> editorial piece, you can see the old logo, which has three pink-ish colors, with <code>#c94665</code> being the dominant one. The old color most likely was too in-your-face for the upcoming redesign at the time. An earlier design of this site used the accent colors for large background areasâ€”among other things.</p>
<p>Accessibility may have already played a role too, however, white text on <code>#d34b6c</code> fails contrast requirements. ðŸ¤¨</p>
<p>As said, I donâ€™t remember, but the color is here to stay.</p>
<p>Bottom line, the color is what it is, thatâ€™s a fact.</p>
<h2>Color #bada55</h2>
<p>Letâ€™s move on to the accent color for editorials and about pages. Similar to the default color, color <code>#bada55</code> is another fact, not an easter egg. The only thing that gives it ðŸ¥š potential is that it can be read as <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/badass">â€˜badassâ€™.</a> Thereâ€™s even a site named bada55.io, but Iâ€™m not gonna link to it, because of some questionable content, but more importantly because it appears to be insecureâ€”lack of https is not an option in modern times.</p>
<p>Since we are already at the topic of color hex values that spell something, let me tell you that â€¦</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really like <code>#c0ffee</code>. â˜•</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back to <code>#bada55</code>, which not only plays a role here, it also happens to be the dominant color on <a href="https://cv.cssence.com/">my rÃ©sumÃ©.</a> (Perhaps I thought Iâ€™m a CSS badass.)</p>
<p>The name of the color is <a href="https://www.color-name.com/hex/bada55">â€˜June Budâ€™,</a> which 1. makes it more adorable (unlike the badass thing), and 2. is something Iâ€™ve learned while writing this text. Personally, I liked the color when I first saw it. Having already used it on my rÃ©sumÃ© subdomain made it a contender when I came up with accent colors for the sections of this site, which happened a long time ago. Hardly a surprise it ended up being used for editorial blog posts and about pages, because those tell you more of a personal story, like my rÃ©sumÃ© does.</p>
<h2>Dark mode</h2>
<p>With the introduction of dark mode, things got more complicated. If you prefer a dark color scheme, you may not encounter any of the aforementioned colors. In dark mode, the default accent color is actually <code>#aa425c</code>, and editorials and about pages use <code>#9fb751</code>.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s even a story on <a href="/2022/dark-mode-color-palette/">how I came up with those dark mode color values.</a></p>
<h2>The future</h2>
<p>Eventually, things will get even more complicated. The new <em>Elegant Style</em> (see Settings page) does not distingiush between blog post types, <code>#d34b6c</code> is the only accent color, and itâ€™s shown in both light and dark mode. When this style becomes the default, <code>#bada55</code> wonâ€™t play a role anymore.</p>
