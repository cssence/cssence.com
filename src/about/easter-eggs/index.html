<p>Does the fact that this site has Easter eggs already count as an Easter egg? Is this meta? Or recursive?</p>
<p>For those unfamilar with the topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Easter egg is a message, image, or feature hidden in software, a video game, a film, or anotherâ€”usually electronicâ€”medium.</p>
<footer>â€” <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)">Easter egg (media), Wikipedia</a></cite></footer>
</blockquote>
<p>If you got here directly (or by accident), let me tell you that this is not just about this page, Iâ€™ve started an entire <a href="/series/easter-eggs/">Easter egg series</a> in early 2024.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you think this site having Easter eggs <strong>does not count</strong> as an Easter egg, I got one more: Every Easter egg page has a root-level emoji class, which led to the first (and hopefully last) instance of me using an emoji as a CSS selector. But only in the <a href="/settings/">advanced theme.</a></p>
