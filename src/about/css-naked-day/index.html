<p>Just as one would expect, CSSence.com has <strong>CSS Naked Day observation</strong> among its <a href="/series/easter-eggs/">Easter eggs.</a> But that hasnâ€™t always been the case.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve been a fan of <a href="https://css-naked-day.github.io/">the idea of CSS Naked Day</a> before I even had this website, but after it went live in 2011, I never really thought about celebrating it. For many years, April&nbsp;9 came and went. It was in 2020, when the topic made <a href="/2020/css-naked-day/">a cameo on my social media feed.</a> What I didn't know at the time: The conversation between Eric Meyer and Brian Kardell already contained an important ingredient that four years later would play a role in my implementation of the temporary stylesheet removal.<sup><a id="ref-fn-1" href="#fn-1" role="doc-noteref" aria-label="Footnote #1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>From 2024 onwards, this site will be displayed without stylesheets on April&nbsp;9.</p>

<h2>Famous words</h2>
<p>Thereâ€™s a reason why CSS became HTMLâ€™s sidekick. It has always been about separation of concerns. This is what the inventor of CSS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A5kon_Wium_Lie">HÃ¥kon Wium Lie</a> had to say about CSS Naked Day:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://css-naked-day.github.io/">
<p>This is a fun idea, fully in line with the reasons for creating CSS in the first place. While most designers are attracted by the extra presentational capabilities, saving HTML from becoming a presentational language was probably a more important motivation for most people who participated in the beginning.</p>

<p>Coincidentally and coincidently, April&nbsp;9 is also the birthday of <a href="/about/matt/">the man behind this website.</a></p>

<li id="fn-1">Or so it did initially. In the implementation that went live, setting a stylesheet to <code>disabled</code> is only done for older browsers. In modern browsers, I decided to swap classnames on page load, to reduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content">Flash Of Unstyled Content (FOUC)</a><sup><a id="ref-fn-2" href="#fn-2" role="doc-noteref" aria-label="Footnote #2">[2]</a></sup> and also <a href="https://css-tricks.com/flash-of-inaccurate-color-theme-fart/">Flash of inAccurate coloR Theme (FART).</a> <a href="#ref-fn-1" role="doc-backlink" aria-label="Back to article">â†©ï¸Ž</a></li>
