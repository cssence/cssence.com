<h1>Color #d34b6c</h1>
<p>The default accent color.</p>

<p>This page is dedicated to CSSenceâ€™s default accent color <code>#d34b6c</code>. According to this siteâ€™s <a href="/about/">about page</a>, â€¦</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[the] color became the default when switching to a flat design in 2014.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two problems here.</p>
<h2>Problem #1</h2>
<p>I donâ€™t remember how I ended up with this color. I know the â€˜whyâ€™, it was because back then I switched my logo from PNG to SVG, and I needed a single color for the fill of the 45Â°&nbsp;bar.</p>
<figure class="standoff" style="--offset:-6rem"><img src="/about/logo.png" alt="Logo of CSSence.com with the default accent color.">
<figcaption>The 45Â°&nbsp;bar, i.e. the part that turns the â€˜câ€™ into an â€˜eâ€™, has color <code>#d34b6c</code> as its default for more than ten years now.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It still begs the question why I needed a color other than the one I already had in place: If you look at the thumbnail image of this ancient <a href="/2012/goodbye-wordpress/">Â»Goodbye WordPressÂ«</a> editorial piece, you can see the old logo, which has three pink-ish colors, with <code>#c94665</code> being the dominant one. The old color most likely was too in-your-face for the upcoming redesign at the time. An earlier design of this site used the <a href="/2022/dark-mode-color-palette/">accent colors</a> for large background areasâ€”among other things.</p>
<p>Accessibility may have already played a role too, however, white text on <code>#d34b6c</code> fails contrast requirements. ðŸ¤¨</p>
<p>As said, I donâ€™t remember, but the color is here to stay.</p>
<h2>Problem #2</h2>
<p>This page is listed in the <a href="/series/easter-eggs/">Easter egg series</a>, but this is not an Easter egg, because the color is just a fact. ðŸ¤“</p>
<h2>Problem #3</h2>
<p>Thereâ€™s one problem too many. Also, like all Easter egg pages, this pageâ€™s path starts with <code>/about/</code>, and as such should have the accent <a href="/about/color-bada55/">color <code>#bada55</code></a>, but instead has the default accent color, for obvious reasons. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_1zoX5Ax9U">Itâ€™s still wrong.</a></p>
