<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p>I’m a front-end web craftsman. I started when Netscape was in its prime; my first website went online in 1998. When Microsoft added <abbr>Xml</abbr><abbr>Http</abbr>Request to Internet Explorer, I began creating applications for browsers, at a time when “web apps” were nothing but a concept on paper, years before the term “<abbr>AJAX</abbr>” was coined. Since then I’ve been working on web-related projects spare-, part- or full-time.</p>
<p>In addition to prototyping in the browser, I focus on creating responsive sites and making them accessible for all kinds of humans, devices and connection speeds. Thanks to fewer browser inconsistences, I enjoy it more than ever.</p>

<h2 id="private-life">Private life</h2>
<p>I like creating all kinds of stuff. Online, that’s a given. Describing my offline hobby, I go by <em>Interior Design Upcycler</em>. I like to run. I used to travel, which lately clashes with my increased interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth">degrowth.</a></p>
<p>But the most interesting journey is fatherhood. And marriage. When I got married to my lovely wife I took her last name, so if you encounter (old) stuff about me online where my birth name <em>Beitl</em> has been used for attribution, that’s why.</p>
