<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>The term <strong>CSSence</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> coined by blending the abbreviation for <em>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</em> and the word <em>essence</em>. By adding the top level domain (TLD) .com you get the URL for the site you are looking at. However, the TLD is misleading, because there is nothing commercial here. Also, no advertisement. You are welcome.</p>
<h2>Knowing the history</h2>
<p>While some <a href="/threads/">threads</a> have been posted in as early as <a href="/2010/">2010,</a> back then this happened on third-party sites. I launched the actual blog in <a href="/2011/">2011</a> on WordPress. This no longer existing predecessor came with the tagline <q>The Essence of <abbr>CSS</abbr></q>. These days, the tagline only makes a cameo appearance in the title on the home page.</p>
<p>The blog was conceived as—and I am quoting my old site here—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] an online magazine about CSS, [which] brings you a fresh article every month, filled with a vast amount of CSS goodness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guess what happened. One article per month. That even worked for a little while, as enough ideas came to my mind, simply by working full-time on web projects. Although back then this translated to spending 85% of said full time in Internet Explorer. At some point however, I was no longer fast enough writing the ideas down because my attention was needed elsewhere. In hindsight, there always are a lot of elsewheres.</p>
<h2>Growing up</h2>
<p>Anyway, since the beginning I’ve been blogging about web design and development, and I continued to do so <a href="/2012/goodbye-wordpress/">after I got my own domain</a>. With the 2015 relaunch, the site evolved to serve as my personal hub, as you can tell by looking at the <a href="/archive/">Big Table.</a> Add a couple of redesigns, and you’ll end up with what you are looking at today.</p>

</figure>
<p>Amidst those redesigns the site has evolved again, because I brought home all the content I published elsewhere, to keep the decentralized web alive. You too should <a href="/2015/own-your-own-data/">own your own data</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, <strong>CSSence</strong> expanded to become my personal brand, I use this handle as my online identity for All Things Web, from <a href="https://codepen.io/cssence">CodePen</a> to <a href="https://github.com/cssence/">GitHub</a> and <del>everything </del><ins><a href="/2019/leaving-social-sites/">very little</a></ins> in between.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this site is curated by me as I’m the main author. I’ve written everything you can find here, unless stated otherwise.</p>
