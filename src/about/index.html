<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>The term <strong>CSSence</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> coined by blending the abbreviation for <em>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</em> and the word <em>essence</em>. By adding the top level domain (TLD) <tt>.com</tt> you get the URL for the site you are looking at. However, the TLD is misleading, because there is nothing commercial here. Also, no advertisement. You are welcome.</p>
<h2 id="knowing-the-history">Knowing the history</h2>
<p>In 2011, it all started with a blog on Wordpress. This <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130331131047/http://cssence.wordpress.com">no longer existing predecessor</a> came with the tagline <q>The Essence of <abbr>CSS</abbr></q>. If you look closely, the tagline is still alive and well, but remains hidden most of the time.</p>
<p>The blog was conceived as&#x200a;—&#x200a;and I am quoting my old site here&#x200a;—&#x200a;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] an online magazine about CSS, [which] brings you a fresh article every month, filled with a vast amount of CSS goodness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guess what happened. One article per month. That even worked for a little while, as enough ideas came to my mind, simply by working full-time on web projects. Although back then this translated to spending 85% of said full time in Internet Explorer. At some point however, I was no longer fast enough writing the ideas down because my attention was needed elsewhere. In hindsight, there always are a lot of elsewheres.</p>
<h2 id="growing-up">Growing up</h2>
<p>Anyway, since the beginning I’ve been blogging about web design and development, and I continued to do so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130831100511/http://www.cssence.com/">after I got my own domain</a>. With the 2015 relaunch, the site evolved to serve as my personal hub, as you can tell by looking at the home page. Paired with the <a href="/2016/redesign/">fresh look</a> it received in 2016 you’ll end up with what you are looking at today.</p>

<figcaption>Off-center logo with the color <code>#d34b6c</code> for the 45°&nbsp;bar. The color became the default when switching to a flat design in 2014.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Give it some time and it will evolve again because I would like to bring home all the content I published elsewhere. I want to help to keep the decentralized web alive. You too should <a href="/2015/own-your-own-data/">own your own data</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, <strong>CSSence</strong> expanded to become my personal brand, I use this handle as my online identity for All Things Web, from <a href="https://twitter.com/cssence">Twitter</a> to <a href="https://github.com/cssence/">GitHub</a> and everything in between.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this site is curated by me as I’m the main author. I’ve written everything you can find here, unless stated otherwise.</p>
