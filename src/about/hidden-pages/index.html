<p>In <a href="/about/404/">Â»Page (Not) FoundÂ«</a>, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ideally, youâ€™ll never end up on the 404&nbsp;page on this site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, there are already three pages on this site that <a href="/404/">link to 404,</a> four if you include <a href="#top">this page about hidden pages.</a> (Five if you include the hidden pages.) So even if <strong>you</strong> never end up there, search engines will find it. They are not allowed to index it, but still.</p>
<p>There are however <strong>two truly hidden pages here.</strong> And only the second page counts as an <a href="/series/easter-eggs/">Easter Egg.</a></p>
<h2>Portfolio</h2>
<p>A portfolioâ€”well, actually just a placeholder for a portfolioâ€”exists for historic reasons. <a href="/about/versions">Version&nbsp;2</a> of this site had a <a href="/2020/redesign-style-and-delight/#navigation-version-2-3">â€˜Workâ€™ entry in the main navigation.</a> The page is still there, but not maintained. If I ever attempt to create a portfolio, it will end up on a dedicated subdomain, so the portfolio placeholder is rather useless. No other page links to <code>/work/</code>, so this Easter egg page cannot make an exception. If you want to see it, you have to manually type in the URL. (If Iâ€™m completely honest, one page does link to the portfolio, but it happens to be the second hidden page.)</p>
<h2>A very special index page</h2>
<p>The second hidden page has been here for a long time. And Iâ€™ll wait for until after Easter 2024 to write about it, so youâ€™ll have time to <a href="https://github.com/cssence/cssence.com/">discover it yourself.</a></p>
<details>
<summary>What if I donâ€™t want to wait?</summary>
<p>Well, you have to. ðŸ¥š</p>
</details>
<h2>More to come?</h2>
<p>Additional hidden pages are on the idea pile, because there are at least two paths on this site that lack an <code>index.html</code> page. If youâ€™d use your <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/1197">address bar as your command line,</a> then those paths would result in 404.</p>
<p>Which brings this piece of writing full circle, and to a close.</p>
