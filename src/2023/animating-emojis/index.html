<p>From <a href="/2022/animating-emojis/">clock faces</a> to <strong>moon phases:</strong> Similar to last year’s animation, I took not just two emojis, but quite a few of them. Turns out we have eight <a href="https://emojipedia.org/search/?q=moon">moon</a> phases to mess with, so once again we have perfect candidates for showing them in succession.</p>
<p>Frankly, from an implementation perspective, this is pretty much the same as last year, … but!</p>
<h2>For The Fifth Time</h2>
<p>When I published <a href="/2023/animating-emojis/">the first “Animating Emoji” in 2019,</a> I did it just for fun, with no intention to make this a recurring thing. Actually, it took me until the third year before I’ve committed to turning this into a series, and it has progressed since. So far that a dedicated <a href="/series/"><strong>Series</strong></a> page made it into the <a href="#navigation">main navigation</a> of this website.</p>
<p>So, as a bonus for the 5th Edition, and to make it technically a bit different to the one from last year, I’ve added a wallpaper for a night sky effect, to put the moon where it belongs.</p>
<p>Did I say wallpaper? While it is just one background image, I’ve added it multiple times, each time with a different background position and even size, to achieve that deep space effect. Doing this also keeps the image size around 100 bytes, so it can be turned into a nice short <a href="/2011/data-uri-images-are-we-there-yet/">data URI.</a></p>

<p>In 2019, I’ve published the first “Animating Emojis” blog post, and along the way it became a pet project inside the pet project that is my website. The 5th&nbsp;Edition just went live, come celebrate with me:<br><a href="/2023/animating-emojis/">cssence.com/2023/animating-emojis</a></p>
