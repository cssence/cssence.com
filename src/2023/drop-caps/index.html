<p>Using <code>float</code> to create a drop cap has never been simple, because you had to tweak the font size and account for an offset to take care of a font’s cap height. These days, browsers that support <code>initial-letter</code> (which at the time of writing this article happen to be all modern browsers except Firefox), do the heavy lifting for you.</p>
</aside>
<p>While reading an article on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/">forbes.com</a> today, I couldn’t help myself. I had to open the Web Developer Console to inspect how they did format the drop caps, i.e. those large initial letters at the beginning of a paragraph that span multiple lines. While their solution obviously works, they achieved it by including special markup in their HTML. The @CSSence in me expected a CSS-only solution. Even more so, the Accessibility Advocate in me expects one too, because without any additional measures, placing the first letter of a word in a separate element makes screen readers burp. So I opened CodePen to create something CSS-only with good old <code>float</code> and <code>::first-letter</code>.</p>
<p>However, while doing so, I dug deeper and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/i/initial-letter/">stumbled upon CSS properties</a> that I completely forgot about: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial-letter"><code>initial-letter</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial-letter-align"><code>initial-letter-align</code></a>.</p>
<p>Maybe the still-not-ideal <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-initial-letter">browser support</a> is the reason I forgot about them. In short: No Firefox. If you can live with non-supporting browsers falling back to not having drop caps, you are on easy street. All you need is the <code>initial-letter</code> declaration, which takes (among other things) the number of lines you want the drop cap to span.</p>
<p>If you additionally want to add some fancy styling that requires margin or padding, a background or a border, it is better to wrap everything inside <code>@supports</code>, to prevent non-supporting browsers from picking up declarations they are not supposed to:</p>
<pre><a href="/2023/drop-caps/code.fail-safe.css">View CSS example.</a></pre>
<p>I’m not seeing <code>initial-letter</code> on the <a href="https://web.dev/interop-2023/">Interop 2023</a> radar, so there’s likely no change in support in the short- to mid-term future.</p>
<h2>Two for the price of one</h2>
<p>For completeness’ sake, I’ve created a solution that pairs the old float method with its new counterpart, to make all browsers happy. Head over to <a href="#showcase">CodePen</a> to see it in action.</p>
