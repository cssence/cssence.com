<p>After having added a <a href="/2023/drop-caps/#comment-1">bookmark to yesterday‚Äôs article about drop caps,</a> I obviously also inspected the bookmarked page, which happens to be the wonderful ‚ÄúExperimental Layout Lab of Jen Simmons‚Äù, in the Web Developer Console. While doing that, I had a <abbr title="today I learned">TIL</abbr> moment.</p>
<p>When it comes to <code>@supports</code>, you can test for a property and their vendor-prefixed companions in one go, without invalidating the whole thing:</p>
<pre><a href="/2023/supports-and-vendor-prefixes/code.forgiving.css">View CSS example.</a></pre>
<p>The above detection works in e.g. Chrome and Firefox, even though they both know nothing of <code>-ms-hyphens</code>.</p>
<p>This is interesting, so these ‚Äúor‚Äù combinations in feature detections are apparently forgiving, similar to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where#forgiving_selector_parsing">forgiving selector parsing</a> in <code>:is</code> and <code>:where</code>. Compare this to a regular list of (top-level) comma-separated selectors: If it contains unknown/invalid segments, the whole list is ignored. Let‚Äôs look at the following example.</p>
<pre><a href="/2023/supports-and-vendor-prefixes/code.invalid.css">View CSS example.</a></pre>
<p>It is safe to assume no browser exists that has implemented both the <code>-moz-</code> and <code>-ms-</code> prefixed variant of <code>::selection</code>, so this selector can never be true. Your only way to style text selection is to split up the selector list, and by doing so, repeating the code for each prefix<sup><a id="ref-footnote-1" href="#footnote-1" role="doc-noteref" aria-label="Jump to footnote #1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Okay, enough, I‚Äôm deviating from the actual topic.</p>
<p>What was it about?</p>
<p>Let me recap by paraphrasing myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A browser <strong>does not</strong> invalidate an <code>@supports</code> rule when it contains a vendor prefix unknown to said browser.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôve created an example that showcases <del>how it works </del><ins>the fact that it does work</ins>.</p>

<p>Vendor prefix is a beta feature, would rather not building a castle üè∞ on it.</p>

<p>Sure, and they are (almost) a thing of the past anyhow, so my blog post is much ado about nothing.</p>
<p>I was just surprised to see them work like that in a supports block, even though this is the way most people would expect. If this didn‚Äôt work, it would be weirder. Which is why, if we could redo #CSS from scratch, invalid segments in comma-separated lists would also be forgiving, as mentioned in the ‚ÄúIncomplete List of Mistakes in the Design of CSS‚Äù:<br><a href="https://wiki.csswg.org/ideas/mistakes">wiki.csswg.org/ideas/mistakes</a></p>
