<p>You may customize this site, at least in theory. The reality however is, right now this page serves as a placeholder for changes to come.</p>
<p>Here is a list of things that are planned in an upcoming version of this site.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Style Toggle:</strong> <a href="/2020/css-naked-day/">CSS</a> is an enhancement anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Monochrome Mode:</strong> <a href="/2019/we-are-web-clerks/#comment-9">Colors</a> are an enhancement anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Dark Mode:</strong> Enjoy this site in a low-light environment.</li>
<li><strong>Syntax Highlighting Theme Switcher:</strong>  As discussed in <a href="/2019/ask-the-user/">“Ask the User”.</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This site works just fine without scripts. (JavaScript is an enhancement anyway.) But this page has to make an exception, because your preferences will be stored locally in your browser, something that is not possible without having JavaScript turned on. The warning message below is issued to indicate this simple fact.</p>
<noscript>
<p>Adjusting anything on this page will not work because your web browser either supports no JavaScript or it has been turned off.</p>

<p>Did you see the warning? If not, then your web browser has JavaScript enabled.</p>
