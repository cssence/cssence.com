<p>You may customize this site, at least in theory. The reality however is, right now this page serves as a placeholder for changes to come.</p>
<p>Here is a list of things that are planned in an upcoming version of this site.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Style Toggle:</strong> <a href="/2020/css-naked-day/">CSS</a> is an enhancement anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Monochrome Mode:</strong> <a href="/2019/we-are-web-clerks/#comment-9">Colors</a> are an enhancement anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Dark Mode<ins><sup><a id="ref-update-1" href="#update-1" role="doc-noteref" aria-label="Jump to footnote #1">[1]</a></sup></ins>:</strong> Enjoy this site in a low-light environment.</li>
<li><strong>Syntax Highlighting Theme Switcher:</strong> As discussed in <a href="/2019/ask-the-user/">“Ask the User”.</a></li>
<li><strong>Time Zone Toggle:</strong> Show local time instead of UTC.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This site works just fine without scripts. (JavaScript is an enhancement anyway.) But this page has to make an exception, because your preferences will be stored locally in your browser, something that is not possible without having JavaScript turned on. The warning message below is issued to indicate this simple fact.</p>
<noscript>
<p>Adjusting anything on this page will not work because your web browser either supports no JavaScript or it has been turned off.</p>

<li id="update-1"><time class="update" datetime="2022-11-13">November 13, 2022:</time> I actually did add Dark Mode as part of the <a href="/2022/dark-mode-color-palette/">Version&nbsp;4 Redesign</a> of this site, but there is nothing relevant for Settings yet. Currently the dark/light theme is applied based on preference only, courtesy of <code>prefers-color-scheme</code>. <a href="#ref-update-1" role="doc-backlink" aria-label="Back to article">↩︎</a></li>
