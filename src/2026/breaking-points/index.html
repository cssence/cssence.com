<p>This is the second blog post of my <a href="/2026/tales-from-the-hospital/"><strong id="miniseries">Tales from the hospital</strong></a> miniseries. I wrote about edge cases in web design that I encountered between surgeries.</p>

<p>For the first couple of weeks I refused to join the hospital Wi-Fi, instead I relied on my phone’s data plan. The problem is, there are thousands of patients and personnel all connecting to the same set of cellular towers, which obviously puts a burden on the system.</p>
<p>What I got in terms of connection speed I would rank somewhere slightly below 3G. Videos on YouTube would load sometimes, depending on the time of day. All other videos did not, I got network errors, most likely due to improperly handled timeouts.</p>
<p>Videos aside, for the majority of websites to load in the first place, I had to be very patient. (Not a problem, I’ve been a patient after all. Get it? Sorry.)</p>
<p>Here’s what I got trying to access a repository on GitHub. The HTML did load, but no stylesheets nor any JavaScript had been applied.</p>
<figure><img src="/2026/breaking-points/github-without-css.webp" alt="My attempt to open the open-ui GitHub repository on a slow internet connection had essentially been a failure." style="--frame:#fff">

<p>No stylesheets? Might as well use a <a href="/2026/text-based-web-browsers/">text-based web browser.</a></p>
<h2>Client-side rendering</h2>
<p>How well a site fares also depends on the underlying technology. If you are lucky, the server already returns your requested content in the retrieved HTML.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have to wait for a large JavaScript file to get requested, downloaded, parsed, and executed, so that it then hopefully will fetch actual content, there’s a chance some step along the way won’t be successful, especially on a slow connection. As a result, you may be starring at a blank page indefinitely, usually without any information that something went wrong.</p>
<p>Put simply, I have a feeling that the “HTML” you got looks like this, courtesy of <em>insert name of JavaScript framework:</em></p>
<pre><a href="/2026/breaking-points/code.app.html">View HTML example.</a></pre>
<p>Whenever that’s the case, <strong>someone did not do the <a href="/2021/the-day-the-website-stood-still/">progressive enhancement</a> homework.</strong></p>
<h2>A call for lightweight websites</h2>
<p>Don’t leave your site visitors empty-handed, do this instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritize content.</li>
<li>Put emphasis on performance.</li>
<li>Fail gracefully.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll keep this essay short, because I’m gonna hand over to Marijke Luttekes, who already wrote what needs to be said in her superb article <a href="https://marijkeluttekes.dev/blog/articles/2026/01/21/why-light-weight-websites-may-one-day-save-your-life/">»Why light-weight websites may one day save your life«.</a></p>
<blockquote cite="https://marijkeluttekes.dev/blog/articles/2026/01/21/why-light-weight-websites-may-one-day-save-your-life/">
<p>I do not see as much talk about website performance and size as I would. Usually, the people talking about it are the artisans who care, or those who have been told by tools like Lighthouse that their stats are wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the upside, my own site performed well on said slow connection. Am I one of those artisans Marijke is talking about?</p>

<p>Seconds after I posted my latest article I ran into this gem from @dbushell.com, so I’m gonna link to it:<br><span aria-hidden="true">🔗 </span><a href="https://dbushell.com/2025/06/13/your-framework-is-showing-nextjs-error/">»Your Framework is Showing«</a></p>
<p>Throwing such an error message towards your visitors violates my “Fail gracefully” bullet point.</p>
