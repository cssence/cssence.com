<p>While you can always <a href="/archive/">head to the archive and browse by year,</a> this index page is a shortcut, as it shows the latest posts across years and blog post types. Basically what you get if you combined <a href="/articles/">Articles</a> and <a href="/threads/">Threads</a> and took the twelve most recent ones.</p>
<details>
<summary>Why isn’t the following list also shown on the <strong>home page?</strong></summary>
<p>The home page displays the latest entry of every blog post type, so that each type appears exactly once, to prevent certain types from being overly represented. Over here on “Latest” the entries are chronological, you see the posts as they happen.</p>
