<p>When I wrote about the <a href="/2024/six-levels-of-dark-mode/">six (eight) levels of dark mode,</a> I also added an <a href="/2024/color-scheme-switcher/">accompanying Extra.</a></p>
<p>I‚Äôm currently writing two articles about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/forced-colors">Forced Colors Mode,</a> they are about to be published. And guess what, I even ended up with some leftovers about CSS&nbsp;System Colors, which I‚Äôve turned into the Extra you are reading right now. So this time I‚Äôm in <em>Essay &amp;&nbsp;Essay &amp;&nbsp;Extra</em> territory.</p>
<hr>
<p>System colors are rather neat, and you can <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2021/css-system-colors/">get quite creative with them.</a></p>
<p>In Forced Colors Mode however, colors are replaced with said system colors, so here they are not just neat but essential. Let me <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/system-color">quote MDN:</a></p>
<blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/system-color">
<p>The <code>&lt;system-color&gt;</code> CSS data type usually reflects the default color choices used for the different parts of a web page.</p>
<p>However, user agents can provide an accessibility feature called forced colors mode, in which colors are restricted into a user- and user agent-defined palette, overriding the author‚Äôs choice of colors in certain properties. In forced colors mode, <code>&lt;system-color&gt;</code> exposes the chosen colors, so that the rest of the page can integrate with them. An example of forced colors mode is <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/09/17/styling-for-windows-high-contrast-with-new-standards-for-forced-colors/">high contrast mode on Windows.</a></p>

<p>While writing aforementioned articles, I‚Äôve encountered quite a few browser inconsistencies. As I‚Äôm about to file bugs, the CodePen I‚Äôve created might come in handy. So let‚Äôs all say ‚ÄúHi!‚Äù to the newest member of <a href="/series/test-pages/">my test page series.</a></p>

<p>While working on other stuff, I ended up with a short piece about CSS System Colors. Admittedly this is rather niche, but maybe it is helpful for someone else, so I‚Äôm getting it out there.<br><a href="/2024/css-system-colors/">cssence.com/2024/css-system-colors</a></p>

<p>I like your theme toggle. In my CodePen I only adhere to user preference.</p>
<p>But now that I think of it, I just got another idea I‚Äôd like to realize if I find the time.</p>

<p>I made an update to my recent CodePen about system colors, both light and dark mode colors are now shown side by side.</p>
<p>The #CSS <code>color-scheme</code> property helped me do it. Unless you view things in Forced Colors Mode (FCM), there we are back to a single column, because both would look the same.</p>
<p>So, in FCM the <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> media query works, but <code>color-scheme</code> is ignored, but that‚Äôs no surprise.</p>
