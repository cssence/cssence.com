<p>Two videos, same topic. One of them says <q>We can now do this in CSS. It’s really easy!</q> and the other tackles the subject by saying <q>We can now do this in CSS. It’s not as easy as you think!</q></p>
<p>The solution *is* easy (that’s the whole point of it becoming a part of CSS). But why some instructors want to make you feel like they’re teaching you atomic science is beyond me.</p>

<p>Yup, instructors should not do that. But maybe they/we shouldn’t say “easy” either. “Easy” can make you feel bad, just like the word “just”.<br><a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/just/">bradfrost.com/blog/post/just</a></p>

<p>I agree. It does assume a certain level of knowledge based on their follower base. Both of their audiences are usually intermediate-advanced CSS devs (mostly, especially if they’ve been following them for a while), so I think this is where the assumption comes from.</p>
