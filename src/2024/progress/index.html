<p>I revived an older mobile phone (which is actually a newer one, long story) to test a web project I’m working on in Firefox. To my surprise, everything looked really broken. Then I realized the browser had not been updated in a year, version was still 114.</p>
<p>Said web project is for a limited audience, so I’m able to use the latest CSS features. Seeing how far behind a browser from a year ago is, makes you appreciate how fast we are getting new features these days.</p>
