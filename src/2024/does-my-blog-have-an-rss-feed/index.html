<p>But there is something else which probably everyone with a personal website should do: adding an RSS feed.</p>

<p>I’m late to the party, but better late than never.</p>
<p>Shoutout to @simevidas@mastodon.social for creating a <a href="https://github.com/cssence/cssence.com/issues/3">Github issue</a> and @stefan@front-end.social for getting in touch via e-mail, i.e. two ways of letting me know they’d like to subscribe.</p>
<p>Well, now they can. And you can too:<br><a href="/rss/">cssence.com/rss</a></p>
<p>PS. Am I the first to offer <a href="/rss/#special-offer">time-based subscriptions?</a></p>

<p>Also, another shoutout to @matthiasott@mastodon.social, the quote in the previous toot is from his "We ❤️ RSS" blog post.<br><a href="https://matthiasott.com/notes/we-love-rss">matthiasott.com/notes/we-love-rss</a></p>
<p>I, for one, also ❤️ RSS.</p>
<p>(Seriously, I must have been living under a rock when it comes to #RSS. After installing the first feed reader I found in Linux Mint’s Software Manager and adding a few feeds, I concluded this is amazingly convenient.)</p>
