<p>Another <a href="/2024/css-naked-day/">CSS Naked Day</a> is about to end. Once again it’s been a delight to find like-minded people by following the #CssNakedDay and #css_naked_day hashtags. Line length has been the only downside of the day, but even that could’ve been mitigated by looking at sites on mobile only.</p>
<p>Some people admitted to cheating. Usually for a good cause, e.g. charts that would otherwise have been inaccessible.</p>
<p>On one site however (I forgot which) it was about something as simple as keeping the styles for the <code>.visually-hidden</code> class in.</p>
<p>This reminded me of last year’s debate whether we need a <em>native visually hidden</em> in HTML or CSS.</p>
<p>So I did some searching online, and collected the results by compiling a list of links, because without doing that I’m fairly certain I’ll end up doing the same search next year.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, good points have been made on both sides.</p>
<p>Proponents usually argue this is such an established pattern, and universally needed, so the way to style it shouldn’t be a mess. <a href="https://kittygiraudel.com/snippets/sr-only-class/">But it is, and always has been,</a> even back when we still called it <code>.sr-only</code>. Their point is, a CSS one-liner would certainly help.</p>
<p>The biggest counterargument is that <code>.visually-hidden</code> is a code smell for not-so-great design: How about *not* hiding the content for *everyone* in the first place?</p>
<h2>All in favor</h2>
<ul>
<li>I think it was Ben Myers who started the debate by making the initial case for it: <a href="https://benmyers.dev/blog/native-visually-hidden/">»Native visually hidden«</a>.</li>
<li>Ben’s pal W. Evan Sheehan followed up with his toughtful take: <a href="https://darthmall.net/weblog/2023/native-visually-hidden/">»Web Native “Visually Hidden”«</a>.</li>
<li>Even though not part of last year’s debate, this list wouldn’t be complete without mentioning <a href="https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html">»Inclusively hidden«</a> by Scott O’Hara, which he wrote in 2017.</li>
</ul>
<h2>All opposed</h2>
<ul>
<li>I only brought up Scott to bring him in again on this side. He wrote <q>so so many words</q>, and those words ended up being the poster-child argument against a native way: <a href="https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2023/03/21/visually-hidden-hack.html">»Visually hidden content is a hack that needs to be resolved, not enshrined«</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion?</h2>
<p>None. I’m torn too. The debate will continue.</p>
<p>Let me end this piece with some neutral information.</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> (at least in versions 3, 4 and 5), you’ll find a helper class to hide content visually.</li>
<li>James Edwards wrote about <a href="https://www.tpgi.com/the-anatomy-of-visually-hidden/">»The anatomy of visually hidden«</a>.</li>
<li>His article contains a reference to a discovery by Manuel Matuzović: <a href="https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2023/zero-width-height-skip/">»Visually hidden links with 0 dimensions«</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And another quick example, after reading <a href="/2024/native-visually-hidden/">today’s post by @CSSence.</a></p>
<p>A visually-hidden CSS mixin:<br><a href="https://codepen.io/kizu/pen/PogeBNd">codepen.io/kizu/pen/PogeBNd</a></p>
<p>Took <a href="https://benmyers.dev/blog/native-visually-hidden/">the code from @ben@a11y.info,</a> and wrapped it with my layered toggles. Now, just adding</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">	--visually: var(--hidden);</code></pre>
<p>to any element makes it visually hidden.</p>

<p>Oh my goodness, you keep churning out next-level stuff. I still have the tab open with <a href="https://kizu.dev/layered-toggles/">your original post</a> that I haven’t read yet. And another tab with <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@hi_mayank/112245090077095254">that ellipsis thing</a> from @hi_mayank@hachyderm.io, it all seems to be 🤯.</p>

<p>It feels conflicting.</p>
<p>But it ties in with some discussions I have had recently. Essentially, visual and auditory perception of content can be quite different.</p>
<p>For me, “visually hidden” works like the counterpart of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/">decorative image patterns.</a></p>

<p>Nicely put.</p>
<p>I’ll admit that <code>.visually-hidden</code> has its uses.</p>

<p>We can be a bit kinder to ourselves sometimes. The web is the only medium that tries to be universally accessible. For any human and even robots.</p>
