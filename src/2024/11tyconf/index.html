<p>The first-ever <a href="https://conf.11ty.dev/2024/">#11tyConf</a> caught me by surprise, as I only found out about the conference on Mastodon while it was already in progress. That’s why I missed the first two talks, but I can watch those too, because all talks are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLxJ6PtuF9M">available online.</a> And watch I will, but for now, rest assured I’ve enjoyed everything I’ve seen live.</p>

<h2 id="summary">(Short) Summary</h2>
<p>It was an interesting mix. Certain talks you could easily see at any regular web conference, others have been more focused on <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">the 11ty static site generator.</a> The spectrum covered by the 11ty talks was already quite unexpected: From small, as in, <em>you</em> can do that, to big, as in, you can do <em>that‽</em></p>
<p>Needless to say, I was delighted to see those big <a href="https://indieweb.org/">#IndieWeb</a> vibes from Henry.</p>
<p>When Dan talked about what it means to build a town that doesn’t exist, I was just flabbergasted. This talk added another meaning to <em>making websites real good:</em> Instead of trying to be perfect in web development terms, focus on having brilliant content, and then make sure to get the content out there for others to see.</p>
<p>Given that I’ve liked the ‘C’ in CSS since day one, seeing Mayank’s talk was truly soothing.</p>
<p>Sara closing the day with a dark mode deep dive resonated with me, because that’s a topic I myself went in <a href="/2024/six-levels-of-dark-mode/">more than six levels deep</a> not too long ago.</p>

<p>I (almost missed and) really enjoyed the first-ever #11tyConf last week.<br><a href="/2024/11tyconf/">cssence.com/2024/11tyconf</a></p>
<p>It had it all: From “<em>you</em> can to that” to “you can do <em>that</em>‽”</p>
