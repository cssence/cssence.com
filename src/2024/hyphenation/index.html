<p>Hyphenation is hard.</p>
<p>To grasp. Luckily, turning it on is easy these days, because <code>hyphens</code> is part of <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-hyphens">Baseline 2023,</a> and thus readily available. That said, it still feels a bit hit-or-miss.</p>
<p>There are guides out there <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-css-word-wrap-overflow-wrap-word-break/">to get you started</a> on <code>overflow-wrap</code> (including its non-standard counterpart <code>word-wrap</code>) and <code>word-break</code>. And when you are done reading about those, you can go all in and learn <a href="https://clagnut.com/blog/2395">all you need to know about hyphenation in CSS.</a></p>
<p>This short blog post is a result of a bug report I got at work yesterday. Hyphens did not show up where we would expect them. Naturally, <a href="https://codepen.io/cssence/pen/pombMEJ">I made a thing</a> on CodePen in hopes I would understand what browsers are doing, but seeing that some words break and others donâ€™t, well, this whole topic remains a black box. E.g., capital letters seem to make a difference in Englishâ€½ ðŸ˜µ</p>
<p>To quote <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/h/hyphenate/">the CSS Tricks Almanac</a>, â€¦</p>
<blockquote cite="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/h/hyphenate/">
<p>Note that <code>hyphens</code> is language-sensitive. Its ability to find break opportunities depends on the language, defined in the <code>lang</code> attribute of a parent element.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make sure to have the correct <code>lang</code> attribute in place. Then, if setting <code>hyphens</code> works out, great. If you need more control, donâ€™t be <code>&amp;shy;</code>, add a soft hyphen in HTML where needed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-is-awesome/">CSS is awesome.</a></p>
