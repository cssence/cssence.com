<p>On <a href="/2021/the-day-the-website-stood-still/">the day this website stood still,</a> which happened almost three years ago, I linked to an article by Ahmad Shadeed, <a href="https://ishadeed.com/article/the-state-of-mobile-first-and-desktop-first/">‚ÄúThe State of Mobile First and Desktop First‚Äù</a>. Ahmad states that he doesn‚Äôt stick to either method, instead he likes to mix them both. And he references an article by Elad Shechter, who calls this approach <a href="https://elad.medium.com/the-new-responsive-design-evolution-2bfb9b504a4e">‚ÄúBasics First‚Äù.</a></p>
<p>All I did when writing my article was to mention that I‚Äôm on board with mixing methods, but I never explained why I too think <strong>Basics First</strong> is the better approach, at least for web development. When it comes to web design, you can still go mobile or desktop first, whichever makes more sense. Well, let‚Äôs face it, mobile first makes more sense, and designers will disagree, given how limiting it is for them. But back to web development.</p>
<h2>Buildup</h2>
<p>Last month, two things have happened that made me want to (re)visit the topic.</p>
<p>First, I learned <a href="https://henry.codes/writing/how-to-make-a-website/">‚ÄúHow To Make a Website‚Äù</a> on Henry Desroches‚Äôs website. Side note: Did I mention there is <a href="/2024/redesigning-in-the-open/">no redesign on the horizon</a> for my site? Seeing how slick and clean Henry‚Äôs site is makes me wanna drop my current design immediately. Luckily I don‚Äôt have time for that. Anyhow, in Henry‚Äôs article there‚Äôs a chapter telling us to stop worrying about the cascade (I agree), which also contains a note saying we should be doing mobile-first design (I disagree, as we‚Äôre about to find out).</p>
<p>Second, I wrote <a href="/2024/superior-range-syntax/">¬ªSuperior range syntax¬´</a>, and in there I explained how the new range syntax finally allows us to be precise when you query breakpoints. The moment you no longer stick to mobile or desktop first, you‚Äôll most likely need ‚Ä¶</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[‚Ä¶] two types of queries in your stylesheet, one where the breakpoint is not yet reached, and one where it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how do we apply Basics First?</p>
<h2>Start with the basics</h2>
<p>In <strong>Mobile First,</strong> you start with the mobile styles and <code>@media (min-width: ‚Ä¶)</code> your way up.</p>
<p>In <strong>Basics First,</strong> you start with the mundane styles and hide the complex or fine-tuned stuff behind media queries. To do so, ideally you can start with the default the browser gives you out of the box, and enhance from there. As a result, a benefit of Basics First is that there is almost no need for overriding your own styles: Desktop does not need to override Mobile, and vice versa.</p>
<h3>Isn‚Äôt Basics First anyhow Mobile First?</h3>
<p>It may be, but not always.</p>
<p>Aforementioned complex stuff could either be in mobile or desktop territory. Quite often it is in the latter. Let‚Äôs take a look.</p>
<ol>
<li>A common theme on mobile is the ‚Äúsingle-column long scroll‚Äù, i.e. something that may be covered by <code>display: block</code>, which is the default for block-level elements anyhow. On desktop however, for certain parts of the page you may want to switch to horizontal orientation by using flexbox or grid. So this more complex style goes into a min-width media query. So far, no difference to the mobile-first approach.</li>
<li>What about the primary navigation of a site? On desktop you may end up with menu items layed out in horizontal orientation, while on mobile you‚Äôll hide the menu items behind a hamburger button. In this case, we could argue both types are complex, and neither is built atop the other. So where to start, mobile or desktop? Well, in a true basics-first fashion, I define the shared styles (e.g. the individual menu items may look alike on mobile &amp;&nbsp;desktop) outside any media query, and then diverge into both worlds with min and max queries.</li>
<li>Which brings us to the last case, where the desktop version is simpler. Can you think of an example? Here‚Äôs mine: I usually align content such as images with the text, while on mobile I break out to the edge of the screen. This time I get the desktop alignment for free, and for mobile I place a negative margin inside a max-width media query. <span lang="fr">Et voil√†,</span> full-width images.</li>
</ol>
<p>As always, your mileage may vary, those things depend heavily on the design you‚Äôre trying to implement. But hopefully this introduction to Basics First will start your own thought process.</p>
<p>While my goal is to reduce the number of CSS overrides, so I don‚Äôt end up with lots of strikethrough declarations in DevTools, I‚Äôm not overdoing it. Usually the result of Basics First is fewer lines of code altogether, but sometimes it‚Äôs the opposite. In that case‚Äîinstead of painstakingly adhering to Basics First and the separation that comes with it‚Äîoverrides are fine.</p>
<h3>A word on native CSS nesting.</h3>
<p>While this is not exclusive to the Basics First approach, being able to place media queries inside a selector allows you to bring the differences closer together.</p>
<pre><a href="/2024/not-always-mobile-first/code.nesting.css">View CSS example.</a></pre>
<h3>A word on the new range syntax.</h3>
<p>If you haven‚Äôt read my article about the <a href="/2024/superior-range-syntax/">new media query range syntax</a> and the issue it solves in the vicinity of a breakpoint, I encourage you to check it out.</p>
<h3>A word on container queries.</h3>
<p>While they are <a href="/2024/is-css-alive/">not top of my list,</a> everything mentioned in this article may be applied to container sizes too, not just the viewport size.</p>
<h2>Content First</h2>
<p>That was all nice and well, but these days responsive web design has shifted towards going <a href="https://css-tricks.com/look-ma-no-media-queries-responsive-layouts-using-css-grid/">entirely without breakpoints.</a> While this works to some degree, it may not take you across the finish line in all cases, so Basics First will still come in handy.</p>
<p>At the end of the day it‚Äôs not so much about the design, the actual content should always have a higher priority.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBasics First‚Äù may be old news, but given all the shiny new #CSS features we got in recent years, I thought I would be a good idea to look at it with a fresh pair of eyes.<br><a href="/2024/not-always-mobile-first/">cssence.com/2024/not-always-mobile-first</a></p>

<p>You added a <abbr title="Your mileage may vary">YMMV</abbr> disclaimer but please allow me to comment on your ‚Äúsingle-column long scroll‚Äù recommendation to use the default display block on mobile and put things like flex or grid behind media queries: You will lose the useful gap property in your mobile layout and would have to use margins/paddings instead, and then undo them for desktop. That seems like a hassle.</p>

<p>Fair point, as always you have to look at the pros and cons before choosing a certain path.</p>
