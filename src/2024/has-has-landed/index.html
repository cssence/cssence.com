<p><code>:has()</code> has been the last entry in my recently published <a href="/2024/is-css-alive/">list of major (new) CSS features.</a> And I concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Game changer! Bigger than all of the above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet, there has been no occurance of this powerful selector on this site. Fair enough, it’s been only a couple of weeks since we got cross-browser support.</p>
<h2>A dash of :has()</h2>
<p>Lately, I’ve been adding a dash of <code>:has()</code> to my pull requests at work whenever possible. So it would only be matter of time until the same is true on my personal site. Last night, while I added support for <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code><sup><a id="ref-fn-1" href="#fn-1" role="doc-noteref" aria-label="Footnote #1">[1]</a></sup>, it finally happened.</p>
<p>When I looked at the <a href="https://github.com/cssence/cssence.com/commit/7cd30e95d0fc5a8156300562a802a63590fe26f1">commit,</a> I found my first personal use of <code>:has()</code> to be rather unusual, which inspired this blog post.</p>
<p>Let me write down what I ended up with verbatim:</p>
<pre><a href="/2024/has-has-landed/code.first-use-of-has.css">View CSS code.</a></pre>
<p>This essentially removes the bullet in every list item that contains a <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element (and nothing else), and turns the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> triangle marker (i.e. its expanded/collapsed indicator) into the list item’s indicator.</p>
<p>While this may be a bit too much of an edge case to end up in somebody’s <em>CSS&nbsp;Reset,</em> I found it cool enough to write about it, because it works without any additional styles.<sup><a id="ref-fn-2" href="#fn-2" role="doc-noteref" aria-label="Footnote #2">[2]</a></sup>. In other words, it can be thrown on top of browsers’ bare user agent styles, which is exactly what I did in the accompanying CodePen.</p>

<li id="fn-1">Another first on this site. While <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> play an important role on one of my <a href="https://cv.cssence.com/">subdomains,</a> my blog managed to get by without them, that is, until I published the note <a href="/2024/seemingly-bookmarked/">»Seemingly Bookmarked«.</a> <a href="#ref-fn-1" role="doc-backlink" aria-label="Back to article">↩︎</a></li>
<li id="fn-2"><code>list-style-position: outside</code> puts the marker outside of the focus ring, so in reality you may want to tweak that too. But you get the idea. <a href="#ref-fn-2" role="doc-backlink" aria-label="Back to article">↩︎</a></li>

<p>We can finally use <code>:has()</code>, and so I did. And it came out weird.<br><a href="/2024/has-has-landed/">cssence.com/2024/has-has-landed</a><br>#CSS</p>
