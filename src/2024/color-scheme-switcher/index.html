<p>Welcome to level&nbsp;8 of <a href="/2024/six-levels-of-dark-mode/">¬ªSix levels of dark mode¬´</a>.</p>
<p>When you build a color scheme switcher, sometimes also known as <em>dark mode toggle</em>, what do you add to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element?</p>
<ol>
<li>A modifier class, like <code>.dark</code>.</li>
<li>A data attribute, like <code>data-theme="dark"</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Crickets.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://cssence.com/2024/six-levels-of-dark-mode/">
<p>Well, we no longer need either one, because we can use <code>:has()</code> to query the real deal.</p>
<pre><a href="/2024/six-levels-of-dark-mode/code.level-8.css">View CSS code.</a></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>That looks rather verbose. Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôll get worse.</p>
<p>But let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves.</p>
<h2>Start without CSS</h2>
<p>As a prerequisite, let‚Äôs assume we have a script that adjusts the content attribute of the color-scheme meta tag to either <code>light</code> or <code>dark</code>, depending on what the user has selected. (You can open the <a href="https://codepen.io/cssence/pen/qBwyvJR">full example</a> to follow along.)</p>
<p>For good measure, we add third state that sets the content attribute to <code>light dark</code> (yes, <code>dark light</code> <a href="https://web.dev/articles/color-scheme">would also work</a>). This is the default when no scheme has been selected, i.e. we use the same scheme as the operating system.</p>
<p>Doing all this already gives us a working scheme switcher, without any CSS involved.</p>
<h2>Add some CSS</h2>
<p>You may now add whatever you need for either light or dark scheme, and then override things for the other. Let‚Äôs assume ‚Äòlight‚Äô goes first, and ‚Äòdark‚Äô does the override.</p>
<pre><a href="/2024/color-scheme-switcher/code.twofold.css">View CSS code.</a></pre>
<p>That would even be it, if we only had two states. But remember the default? We need one additional chunk.</p>
<pre><a href="/2024/color-scheme-switcher/code.threeway.css">View CSS code.</a></pre>
<p>This is the minimal setup, you can expand it from here.</p>
<p>Now I hear you say, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs all nice and well, but a simple <code>.dark</code> class at the HTML element is way easier‚ÄΩ‚Äù</p>
<p>Agreed. However, the reason for doing it this way is similar to applying styles based on ARIA attributes. Imagine a button that opens a dropdown, it has a nice little triangle marker to indicate the fact. Sure, you can add an <code>.expanded</code> class to the button when it has been clicked, and rotate the triangle based on that class. But, you could also rotate the triangle based on <code>[aria-expanded="true"]</code>. Doing the former, all you are testing is whether adding a class works. Doing the latter, you add a built-in test for the underlying accessibility feature.</p>
<p>The same can be said for the long selector in this blog post. Using it adds a test for the HTML+JS version of the color scheme switcher, free of charge.</p>
<p>Luckily, native CSS nesting has arrived, so you do not even need to repeat the long selector, you can just add everything in there.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll acknowledge there is a downside, but it has nothing to do with the selector, because the downside is also present when doing it the old-fashioned way: Due to the non-boolean nature of our scheme switcher, we have to duplicate the override styles, because even with CSS nesting we cannot combine a media query and a regular selector.</p>
<p>One more thing: You can also use the tilde attribute selector on the content attribute.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs it. If you didn‚Äôt already, head over to CodePen to see a working color scheme switcher.</p>

<p>I only found out last night that @sarajw@front-end.social (sry for dragging you into this one too üò¨) has written an in-depth intro to color-scheme on her site:<br><a href="https://sarajoy.dev/blog/color-scheme/">sarajoy.dev/blog/color-scheme</a></p>
<p>Keep reading until the end, she also added noteworthy ‚ÄúFurther reading‚Äù material to her article.</p>

<p>Great article by @pepelsbey@mastodon.social on making a color scheme switcher:<br><a href="https://htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2024/9/">htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2024/9</a></p>
<p>I like the bonus chapter; TIL you can set a <code>media</code> attribute on <code>&lt;meta name="theme-color"&gt;</code>, really nifty.</p>
<p>Another TIL regarding <code>media</code> is that you can even negate all (<code>not all</code>), although in that particular case it‚Äôs probably easier to set the stylesheet to <code>disabled</code>.</p>
