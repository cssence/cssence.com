<p>It was only last week <a href="/2024/lh-unit-support/">when I learned</a> we have cross-browser support for the <code>lh</code> unit.</p>
<p>Well, color me impressed, I realized its root relative companion <code>rlh</code> also exists, so I had to look up what else is out there, and it turns out we have all of them: <a href="https://nerdy.dev/new-relative-units-ric-rex-rlh-and-rch">Adam Argyle wrote about the relative units.</a> They may have gone unnoticed now that those container units are all the rage.</p>
<p>In case you donâ€™t know what they are for, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length">MDN has you covered.</a></p>
<p>Since Adam wrote his piece, some progress was made, e.g. the <code>cap</code> unit now has cross-browser support. But most of the root relative ones have not, so either leave them be, or use them with a fallback in place.</p>
<h2>A real world example</h2>
<p>What I do like is that both <code>lh</code> and <code>rlh</code> are already usable. Iâ€™ve worked on a number of projects where I wanted the margin between two paragraphs to be the excact size another line of text would occupy. To achieve this, Iâ€™ve used <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code> and took the line-height into account, in other words I had to calculate the value upfront, or even throw custom properties at <code>calc()</code>. This is something I wonâ€™t need to do anymore.</p>

<p>Not only is the second one shorter (at least in this case), using <code>lh</code> makes it clear what the actual intent is.</p>
<h2>The future</h2>
<p>Things may even get more exciting once we have <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height-step"><code>line-height-step</code></a>, which is part of <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-rhythm/">CSS Rhythmic Sizing.</a> This might take a while.</p>
<p>For now, what I do like even more is that <code>rex</code> ðŸ¦– exists.</p>
<p>Ah yes, I almost forgot: Iâ€™ve created an example page, that started out as a test page, but became an overview of all relative units, including the root relative ones.</p>
