<p>While using the relatively new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color-mix"><code>color-mix</code></a> function, I noticed browser differences in Forced Colors Mode that I found worth exploring. Granted, it‚Äôs rather unusual that <code>color-mix</code> and Forced Colors Mode are part of the same sentence, let alone inspiration for a blog post.</p>
<p>Well, what would you expect to happen when the color palette is reduced to a bare minimum? There is not a lot to mix in the first place. And <em>not a lot</em> is what is happening in Chromium-based browsers, <code>color-mix</code> doesn‚Äôt really do anything: The colors you throw into the mix do not matter, if the function is applied to e.g. <code>color</code> or <code>border-color</code>, you end up with the text color. And if it is applied to <code>background-color</code>, you end up with whatever the background should be on a given element, most often Canvas.</p>
<p>This is where Firefox enters the picture. The moment all the colors are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/system-color">CSS system colors</a>, Firefox <strong>actually performs the mix.</strong></p>
<pre><a href="/2024/color-mix-in-forced-colors-mode/code.color-mix-with-system-colors.css">View CSS code.</a></pre>
<p>So if we mix CanvasText with Canvas 50:50, like shown in the example above, we do get the inbetween color in Firefox.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt stop there. I tried other combinations. If we mix a system color with transparent, we are back to CanvasText. Unless the mix happens for <code>background-color</code>, in that case we actually get a semi-transparent version of the system color. üòÆ</p>
<p>Compare this to Chromium-based browsers, where we end up with CanvasText even if we ‚Äúmix‚Äù Mark with Mark.</p>
<p>In the early stage of discovering the issue, I found it cool what Firefox is doing. And I was tempted to say the other browsers should follow suit. But on second thought, Forced Colors Mode is about reducing the palette, hence the result of <code>color-mix</code> has little to no value here. And while I could even argue that mixing Canvas and CanvasText could be useful, the moment we start doing weird things like mixing CanvasText with LinkText we realize that this is actually nonsensical, right?</p>
<p>I‚Äôll file a Firefox bug. Reluctantly?</p>

<p>Hello #WebDev people, do you think my latest encounter concerning Forced Colors Mode and the #CSS <code>color-mix</code> function is a #Firefox bug?</p>

<p>I agree with your reasoning and conclusion, it‚Äôs a Firefox bug.</p>
<p>Unless the CSS rule also has <code>forced-color-adjust: none</code>, values with <code>color-mix()</code> should be ignored, even if it‚Äôs mixing system color keywords.</p>

<p>The #CSS working group discussed my <code>color-mix()</code> issue earlier this week, and @tabatkins@mastodon.social made a good case for not allowing the mix of system colors in Forced Colors Mode, stating it ‚Ä¶</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[‚Ä¶] might actually harm the users in question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you look at the IRC log, a case was made for <code>:disabled</code>, but here I too would argue to go with <code>opacity</code> instead. And if devs want a color mix really badly, they could resort to <code>forced-color-adjust</code>‚Äîassuming they know what they are doing.</p>
