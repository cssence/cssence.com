<p>Ah, the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/what-is-the-top-layer/">CSS top layer,</a> what a great invention. And the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API">Popover API,</a> incredibly helpful for accessibility.</p>
<p>Over at work, while implementing my first ever native popover (which in the meantime already got shipped), I noticed inconsistent behavior between the Chromiums and Firefox. This does not come as a surprise, it‚Äôs just a small price to pay for all the new shiny things we are getting these days.</p>
<p>The next thing I would usually do is file a browser bug. But in this case I‚Äôm once again not really sure which browser gets it right; though I‚Äôm secretly hoping it is Firefox, so I can file a Chromium bug.</p>
<h2>The default</h2>
<p>We got these new user agent styles for native popovers: They add a border and background color to the popover, set its size to fit the content, and center the whole thing. A good start for a dialog, but if you use the Popover API for things like tooltips and dropdowns, you most likely end up undoing said default.</p>
<p>We made jokes about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/">centering stuff, which is easy these days.</a> For native popovers, the following happens:</p>
<pre><a href="/2024/popover-inset-issue/code.popover-centering.css">View CSS example.</a></pre>
<p>As the popover has block and inline size constraints, it will be centered inside the viewport.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>If I want to place the popover elsewhere, I can adjust top, right, bottom, and/or left‚Äîor even better, the logical property variants thereof.</p>
<p>But if my popover immediately follows the button that opens it, wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if I could just do <code>inset: unset</code> and the popover is placed underneath visually (while still being part of the top layer)?</p>
<p><strong>That is exactly what Firefox is doing.</strong> But the Chromiums place the popover in the top left corner (or top right when the <a href="https://rtlstyling.com/posts/rtl-styling">direction is right to left,</a> you get the idea).</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="comparison.webp" alt="Browser screenshots for comparison." style="--frame: ">
<figcaption>While Firefox (shown on the left) places the popover below the triggering button, it ends up in a corner in Chromium-based browsers.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><abbr title="For what it‚Äôs worth">FWIW</abbr>, changing <code>margin</code> and <code>position</code> does not alter the behavior, as you‚Äôll see if you examine the CodePen I made for the issue. While you take a look, I‚Äôll be on the social networks, in hopes of finding out who does it right.</p>

<p>Hello Chromium and Firefox people, can you help me figure out which browser behavior is correct? It‚Äôs about the Popover API and the Top Layer:<br><a href="/2024/popover-inset-issue/">cssence.com/2024/popover-inset-issue</a></p>
<p>Please be Firefox, please be Firefox. ü§û</p>

<p>It looks similar to what I tried to understand a few months ago. Still not sure! See the replies, too.<br><a href="https://mastodon.social/@pepelsbey/113385103374423675">mastodon.social/@pepelsbey/113385103374423675</a></p>

<p>Great, thank you, that helps. So yeah, judging by your thread, it‚Äôs still <abbr title="to be defined">TBD</abbr>.</p>
<p>Eventually it won‚Äôt matter much because we‚Äôll just anchor-position everything.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there should be concensus among browsers, one way or another. Based on what I‚Äôve read in the blog post from @hdv@front-end.social, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs gonna be ‚Äúanother‚Äù:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, elements lose their position context when they are upgraded to the top layer. And that‚Äôs okay, we have other options.</p>
