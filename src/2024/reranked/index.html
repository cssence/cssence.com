<p>Iâ€™ll admit to updating my <a href="/popular/"><code>/popular/</code></a> page rather infrequently, because itâ€™s manual labor to import and crunch the numbers; time Iâ€™d like to spend otherwise. Today was one of those updates, but I also had to change the underlying calculation, which is why things went a bit topsy-turvy.</p>
<p>To my surprise, the post on the media query range syntax that I wrote less than a month ago already made it into the Top&nbsp;3. Who knew my dear readers would enjoy leading-edge #CSS stuff. ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>In case you ask (I know you wonâ€™t):</p>
<p>CodePen views and likes no longer contribute, them playing a role was reminiscent of a time when I directly linked to my pens, not having a backstory on my site. This stopped being the case years ago. Now that those numbers no longer add weight in favor of pen-related blog posts, all of them simply dropped out of the ranking.</p>
<p>Seeing posts from the same category taking their place made me think I did something wrong, but those are just increased page views since the last update.</p>
