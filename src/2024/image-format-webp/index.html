<p>Friendly reminder, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/">webp image format</a> is a thing.</p>
<p>I’ve always been using an image compressor to optimize images on my website. Looking at the source code, apparently it has only been July of last year when I started using webp, and I’ve been using it pretty much exclusively ever since.</p>
<p>It comes out superior for both lossy and lossless images. <a href="https://caniuse.com/webp">Browser support</a> for webp has been there since what feels like forever.</p>
