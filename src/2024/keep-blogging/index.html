<p>I was on vacation with my family when <a href="/2024/5000-days/">the oldest entry on my site turned 5000&nbsp;days old.</a> Without access to my computer, I wasn’t able to write a proper article, but now I got to it.</p>
<p>5000&nbsp;days ago this site didn’t exist. Nor did its predecessor on WordPress. So how can the oldest entry be 5000 days old? According to the <a href="/about/">About page,</a> …</p>
<blockquote cite="https://cssence.com/about/">
<p>[…] some threads have been posted in as early as 2010, back then this happened on third-party sites. I launched the actual blog in 2011 on WordPress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the early days, I didn’t <a href="/2023/originally-published-elsewhere/">do things in true IndieWeb spirit,</a> but eventually I got to the point where all my content became available on this site. I migrated historic content too, and as a result, an index page for <a href="/2010/">the year&nbsp;2010</a> exists.</p>
<h2>Check your calendar</h2>
<p>Why 5000&nbsp;days and not any number of years instead? Well, what would be the base for any celebration? Still October&nbsp;31, 2010, the first tweet? Or should I ignore third-party content and use January&nbsp;26, 2011, the date of <a href="/2011/css3-is-dead/">my first article</a>  on WordPress. What about December&nbsp;23, 2011, the day I bought the cssence.com domain? March&nbsp;30, 2012, the initial deployment on that domain? It’s complicated, but why bother?</p>
<p>I didn’t plan ahead calculating 5000&nbsp;days, instead I stumbled upon the milestone by accident. But the reason for writing the corresponding note has anyhow been a different one:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://cssence.com/2024/5000-days/">
<p>We’re only halfway through the year, and 2024 is already my best #blogging year ever. Out of the 250 posts written in almost 14 years, more than ⅕th are a result of the last six months. And given how crappy 2023 has been for me healthwise, I couldn’t be happier.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>I’m back</h2>
<p>I enjoy blogging more than ever.</p>
<p>If you do not own your own space on the web yet, I encourage you to read <a href="https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse">“Into the Personal-Website-Verse”</a> by Matthias Ott.</p>
<p>As for this site, I see many new articles on the horizon. I’ll also set time aside to document more <a href="/series/easter-eggs/">Easter eggs.</a> And I’ll expect lots of tinkering with the underlying code that gives my content a cozy home. Take a peak at my backlog:</p>
<ul>
<li>A template mechanism for new blog posts is long overdue, currently I write a new post by copying an old one and deleting its content. 🙄</li>
<li>My comment system is still manual labour, but I may have reached the limit of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/manual_until_it_hurts"><em>manual until it hurts</em></a> IndieWeb principle. Having <a href="/2024/farewell-twitter/">ditched Twitter</a> for the second and final time allows me to focus solely on Mastodon, so this would be a good time to implement a semi-automatic solution. 😶</li>
<li>Last but not least, I’ve started working on a new theme. 🤩</li>
</ul>
<p>Time will tell when these things go live.</p>
<p>Here’s to the next 5000&nbsp;days.</p>
