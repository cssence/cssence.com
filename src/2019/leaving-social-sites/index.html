<p>In a few months time I will be able to celebrate <em>Five Years Without Facebook.</em> I deleted my account in 2014, and it was the second and final time I did so, because since then I did not crawl back by creating yet another profile. Then there was Google+. I thought about deleting that account, but Google beat me to it. Anyhow, this post is about something else, although the underlying reasons are similar.</p>
<p>My resumé lists all those links to other places on the web where you can learn more about me, but said list keeps getting shorter. End of 2018 I deleted my profile on <a href="https://www.xing.com/">XING</a>, the European counterpart of LinkedIn, only to be followed by the deletion of my actual <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> profile a couple of months later.</p>
<p>Side note: This is not about some Social Site Detox, such as not reading and posting for three weeks. Nor about leaving the account in a dormant state. No, I took out my data (if possible) and deleted everything without a chance of recovery.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>For me personally, whenever the nuisances&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;that inevitably come with the usage of such services&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;start to outweigh the benefits, it is time to leave.</p>
<h2 id="leaving-mediumcom">Leaving Medium.com</h2>
<p>If we stretch the definition of <em>Social Sites</em> to include a popular writing platform, then let me tell you this: In the latest installment of my ongoing web farewell tour, I’ve left <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a>, a place where I’ve been syndicating my blog posts to. Not an easy thing to do if this <a href="/2015/own-your-own-data/">is the only place where your articles reside</a>, but as I have followed the IndieWeb principle <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">“publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere”</a>, I could just quit Medium on my own terms. Pulling the plug on them meant that I only had to adjust <a href="/2017/metalsmith-io/">my static site generator</a> so it would no longer generate references to Medium.</p>
<p>In this particular case I thought the Medium experience was getting worse over time, mostly as a result of their attempt to make money. To be clear, this is perfectly fine, they should try to monetize their platform to stay successful, but that does not mean that I have to keep up with this.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>I’ve previously mentioned my attempt to un-Google my Android phone in <a href="/2018/no-webfont-no-cry/">this post about web fonts</a>, an endeavor that is currently on hiatus, as I seem to be having a bad Android year. Sadly, two phones became unusable because of broken screens. Independent of that, I stopped using the Google mail service quite some time ago, so it is only a matter of time before my Google engagement will be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>If we stretch the definition of <em>Social Sites</em> ever further, there is an app named <a href="https://web.whatsapp.com">WhatsApp</a>, that is about to become ad-infested, so I am going to bid farewell to them before it happens.</p>
<p>Which leaves me with Twitter. I use it to enable comments on my site, so it is still useful to reach out to people. Time will tell for how long. Until then, <a href="https://twitter.com/cssence">follow me</a> if you feel so inclined.</p>
