<p>Great article, comes in handy as a cheat sheet for print. And so true. We think about print even less than accessibility. (Also: reminds me of my very first medium post <a href="/2015/print-first/">medium.com/@cssence/print-first-ef5806ba9989</a>—Good times 🙂</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>I wouldn’t differentiate here, because by optimizing for print we are making our websites more accessible at the same time.</p>
<p>PS: When I saw your name I had to think a little about where I know you from, but now I know. I recently read your great <a href="/2016/the-javascript-wars/">Javascript Wars</a> post 😉</p>

<p>Agreed, in this case accessibility comes as a bonus.</p>
<p>PS. After reading your post I had to check my own site to see if my print styles still work 😉</p>
