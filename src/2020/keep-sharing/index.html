<p>I redesigned mine earlier this year, but I haven’t been good about remembering to post new stuff.<br><a href="https://studiochris.us/">studiochris.us</a></p>

<p>Congrats, Chris! 🙌😄 It was the same with my first site. I did not post new stuff for almost five years… 🙈<br>Don’t be too hard on yourself. But if you try to make it a habit to regularly write just a little bit, you’ll end up posting more often. And it’s worth it!</p>

<p>I know the feeling.</p>
<p>I won’t add my site to this great list, as my relaunch predates 2020 by a month. But I recently finished blogging about the redesign, so that took “just” one year. 🤦<br><a href="/2020/redesign/">cssence.com/2020/redesign</a></p>
