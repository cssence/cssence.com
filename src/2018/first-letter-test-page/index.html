<p>I made a test page for <code>::first-letter</code> many years ago, but I couldn’t find it. Which is why I created this revised page. Needless to say, after I finished it I found the original, so this time I <a href="https://codepen.io/cssence/pen/yqaGqB">put it on CodePen</a> for my future self and everybody else.</p>
<p>My initial test page used floats to create large drop caps, but they accounted for additional problems, which is why I tried to keep things simple.</p>

<p>You’d think that handling something as old as this pseudo-element would have been sorted by now, but on top of inconsistencies I might have even found bugs. Granted, selecting the first letter is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/%3A%3Afirst-letter">quite challenging.</a></p>
<p>Without going into detail here, I’d say Firefox and Safari drew the same conclusions from the specification.</p>
