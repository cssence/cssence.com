<p>With great interest I read about <a href="https://gettalong.org/blog/2018/privacy-enhancements.html">privacy enhancements</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/_gettalong">Thomas Leitner</a>, where he explains how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> by the <em>European Union</em> inspired him to make some changes on his site. I thought about doing something similar, but this was not the kind of topic that makes you drop everything else. So nothing changed for several months. In October <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45963935">Apple CEO Tim Cook chimed in</a>, and I finally took action during the Christmas Holidays.</p>
<h2>Turning regulations into something positive</h2>
<p>General Data Protection Regulation? Sounds fun. Wrong.</p>
<p>But you can use such regulations to reflect on the innards of your site. In my case it was simple. I <strong>do not</strong> collect any data. No tracking. Nothing at all. But the way the web works, this does not mean I can stop here. Whenever you see source code on this site, <a href="https://prismjs.com/">PrismJS</a> is used for syntax highlighting. PrismJS has always been part of this site, i.e. it is not loaded from a remote source. If no remote server is needed to fulfill your request, none of your data needs to be transferred there, so no problem. Which meant I had to find the parts that <strong>do</strong> point to a remote source.</p>
<p>My search revealed two culprits, 1. Google web fonts, and 2. that <a href="https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/embedded-pens/">CodePen script</a> that turns links into <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>-embedded live demos. This is how I handled the situation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Web font:</strong> Instead of hosting <em>Open Sans</em> myself, I simply removed the font. It was only used for headings anyway, the body text already relied on whatever serif fallback font your browser offers.<!-- I had a serif web font in place, but I removed it some time after that [2016 redesign](/2016/redesign/) improve the site performance.--></li>
<li><strong>Live demos:</strong> I’ve removed the script altogether, so each link to CodePen remains a link, but they now look like click-to-play rectangles with thumbnail background images.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both measures led to increased performance, but you could quibble over the not-as-great experience. Well, it depends. If you use a browser extension like <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger</a>, said CodePen script never got executed. And maybe you have <a href="/2018/no-webfont-no-cry/">turned off web font loading, as I did</a>.</p>
<p>With these changes in place, no matter which page on cssence.com you look at, your IP address won’t be transferred to a third-party location anymore. Sure enough, your IP address will be transferred to the server that hosts my site, which happens to be the awesome <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>, but if a regulation would forbid that, there won’t be a web anymore.</p>
<figure class="standout"><img src="/2018/data-protection-rules/farewell-fun-footer.png" alt="No style sheets were harmed while making this website. Other assets were not so lucky. One font did suffer.">
<figcaption>The original fat footer on this website included a cheerful disclaimer stating that style sheets were treated properly (and web fonts poorly). Now that I no longer use web fonts, I put the footer on a diet. Given how boring the current footer looks, you could conclude that Data Protection Initiatives suck the fun out of everything.</figcaption>

<h2>Privacy, center stage</h2>
<p>Last year I proclaimed that <a href="/2017/accessibility-for-everyone/">2017 was the year of accessibility</a>. If you consider everything that happened in 2018, from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/mark-zuckerberg-testimony.html">Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony</a> to the record number of people affected by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.de/data-hacks-breaches-biggest-of-2018-2018-12?op=1">data breaches</a>, then you’ll remember 2018 as the year of Privacy and Data Protection. Or the lack of those things.</p>
<p>At the very least, the topic got the deserved attention, so even average Joe should be more informed after everything that has happened. For all those companies out there (the one I work for included), it took enormous efforts to implement measures to follow the new Regulation. But it is a good thing in the right direction.</p>
