<p>This page takes the burden of an 🥚 hunt away from you, as it already presents <strong>the <a href="/about/easter-eggs/">built-in shenanigans</a></strong> in a nice compact list. Then again, not really, because below are only those I had the time to write about, so you could still rummage through the source code and look for more. Also, this site is constantly changing, additional eggs may end up in the basket.</p>
