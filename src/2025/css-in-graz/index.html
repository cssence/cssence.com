<p>I went to Graz with a talk named “CSS has come full circle” in my backpack, that I presented at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/css-in-graz/events/308080536/">seventh CSS-in-Graz meetup.</a> I was followed by other attendees and our host <a href="https://www.matuzo.at/">Manuel</a>, who made up some inspiring impromptu talks on the spot.</p>
<hr>
<p>Usually I do a little coverage of the event, but it was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced27g4e6xwo">overshadowed by current events [content warning: disturbing scenes].</a> Violence has no place in society. 💔</p>
