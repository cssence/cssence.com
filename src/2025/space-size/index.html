<p>Ah, the size of space! No, not the <a href="https://neal.fun/size-of-space/">great visualisation by Neal Agarwal.</a></p>

<p>In an ever-growing universe, I guess it’s tough for scientists to calculate how big space is, but that’s beside the point, because this article is dedicated to the new CSS <code>space-size</code> property, which finally gives us a way to tweak indentation when space characters instead of tabs are in play. Contrary to <code>tab-size</code>, it comes with some (necessary) limitations, as it only affects <strong>leading spaces.</strong> So nothing changes for people who still think that a gap the size of <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/punctuation-capitalization/spaces-after-period/">two spaces should come after the period</a> at the end of a sentence, but I digress.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, no browser has support for <code>space-size</code>, but here’s how it will eventually work:</p>
<pre><a href="/2025/space-size/code.syntax.css">View CSS example.</a></pre>
<p>While it looks as if we are just reusing the <code>tab-size</code> syntax, the behavior is actually quite different: We specify a positive number to tell the browser how many spaces are used for indentation in the HTML. Put simply, the number states how many leading spaces represent a single tab character. That’s good news for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Without that number, the browser would need to perform some heuristic exercise to guess the intended indentation, which could lead to undesirable results.</li>
<li>Setting a number in the first place means we opt in to “space-to-tab conversion”, whereas the default <code>none</code> implies we don’t.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the <em>actual indentation</em> we still rely on <code>tab-size</code>’s value, which comes with the bonus that indentation cannot get out of sync when both tabs and spaces are used to indent a line in the same HTML file.</p>
<p>By the way, when not set, <code>tab-size</code> defaults to eight, so in most cases it’s probably best to declare these properties in tandem, like so:</p>
<pre><a href="/2025/space-size/code.tandem.css">View CSS example.</a></pre>
<p>That’s about it, now we’ll have to wait for <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">green lights on caniuse.com.</a></p>

<p>On this day, one year ago, I wrote in my <a href="/2024/digital-gardens/">Digital gardens</a> editorial:</p>

<p>Apparently I’ve changed my mind, because today I finally did pull a prank, as there is clearly no <code>space-size</code> on the horizon. Sorry for wasting everybody’s time, it won’t happen again.</p>
<p>Make sure to use <a href="/series/tabs-over-spaces">tabs instead of spaces,</a> there’s a reason we have a dedicated Unicode character. TL;DR, tabs are superior.</p>

<p>Still early days for the new #CSS <code>space-size</code> property, as no browser maker has started implementing it, but here’s what you need to know:<br><a href="/2025/space-size/">cssence.com/2025/space-size/</a></p>
<p>Begs the question, are you on Team Tabs or Team Spaces?</p>
