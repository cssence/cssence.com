<p>… and by a chain of events I ended up realizing that she is not only running the CSS Joy webring, but also <a href="https://rs.sjoy.lol/">RSS Joy!</a> Genius!</p>
<p>You should have seen my face when I noticed that she added my lil RSS feed there too. Thank you Sara. 🙇</p>

<p>Thanks to your exchange I noticed that cssence wasn’t appearing anymore in my <a href="https://villepreux.net/web-feed/">personnal RSS aggregator</a> 😢</p>
<p>(Reason was I was watching cssence.com instead of cssence.com/all, which is the one url that contains the application/rss+xml alternate head link my code was looking for)</p>
<p>I can now follow you again Matthias!</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, my root path doesn’t have <a href="/rss/">a feed.</a> Maybe I should change that.</p>
