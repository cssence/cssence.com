<p>And if you are interested in an ever so thorough take on the subject of AI, I highly recommend this @btconf@mastodon.social talk by @tink@w3c.social:<br><span aria-hidden="true">🔗 </span><a href="https://youtu.be/fyRxd072JrA">“There is no spoon”</a></p>

<p>Having watched Léonie’s talk this morning, I was about to write something along the lines of: If AI can help a blind person “see” the world around them in real time, I’m all for it. But if it helps you write an e-mail that nobody cared about in the first place, it’s just a waste of energy.</p>
<p>But apparently I can simply quote <a href="https://front-end.social/@hdv/114580684112012591">@hdv@front-end.social:</a></p>
<blockquote cite="https://front-end.social/@hdv/114580684112012591">
<p>I do think usefulness can outweigh ethical issues in some very specific use cases, eg if users want to make use of these tools to remove accessibility barriers they’re affected by</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now I got two more blog posts to read. I’ll start with<br><span aria-hidden="true">🔗 </span><a href="https://hidde.blog/ethical-ai/">“Is ‘ethical AI’ an oxymoron?”</a><br>…</p>

<p>They thought they were creating Artifical Intelligence.</p>
<p>What they actually were creating is Artificial Hallucination.</p>

<p>Agree. I made the same point at a CMS conference I was on a panel a few weeks ago. Everything is a hallucination.</p>

<p>You’re too kind, Ethan.</p>
<p>So yeah, ethics aside, it only took copyright infringements and vast amounts of energy to produce hallucinations. And if we use these hallucinations to generate new content, it’ll become new training data. Garbage in, garbage out, on a loop. AI regurgitation, reminds me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DyEgh-kkkAA">reuploading to Youtube over and over again.</a></p>
<p>At least we already see the resistance, people putting “100% human-made” stickers on their blogs.</p>

<p>So in the end, youtube videos of youtube videos uploaded as youtube videos which in turn get uploaded as youtube videos, each generation worse like going from 4K to HD to VHS to a blurry mess; in the end we get the "gray goo" everyone feared was coming with nanobots, only it’s the “AI slop” version… hopefully only digital and not rendered in actual molecules…</p>
