<p>CSSence is moving to its own domain cssence.com, I expect everything to be back online by the end of April.</p>
<p>In the meantime I’ve posted this message, so you (and Google, Bing, etc.) can get your bookmarks updated.</p>
<p>Although it seems as if articles already got lost, I assure you this is not what happened. I’m removing article by article from cssence.wordpress.com, starting with the newest. However, they do not yet show up at the new place. Honestly, I didn’t think it would take this long, but I’m not just moving content – as it would be the case with a <em>wordpress.com to wordpress.org</em> transition. Instead, I’m also switching from Wordpress to “something else”.</p>
<p>Think about it this way:<br>The emptier this place gets, the closer <a href="/">cssence.com</a> gets to <strong>lights on.</strong> 😉</p>

<p><strong>Oh, … — Hello!</strong></p>
<p><strong>You're looking at the future home of cssence.wordpress.com.</strong> Sadly, the former site (the one hosted at wordpress) no longer contains any articles.</p>
<p>I am currently migrating all content to this domain, but the transition period takes longer than expected. Turns out every article needs a major overhaul, not just export/import. Anyway, as soon as this site goes beta, the complete 2011 archive&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;and of course the new 2012 stuff&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;will be back online, right here. Scout's honor!</p>

<p>You are reading this on cssence.com, hence the transition is complete. 🚀</p>
