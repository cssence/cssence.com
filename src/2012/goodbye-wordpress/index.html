<h2>Important update: cssence is moving</h2>
<p>cssence is moving to its own domain cssence.com, I expect everything to be back online by the end of April.</p>
<p>In the meantime I’ve posted this message, so you (and Google, Bing, etc.) can get your bookmarks updated.</p>
<p>Although it seems as if articles already got lost, I assure you this is not what happened. I’m removing article by article from cssence.wordpress.com, starting with the newest. However, they do not yet show up at the new place. Honestly, I didn’t think it would take this long, but I’m not just moving content – as it would be the case with a <em>wordpress.com to wordpress.org</em> transition. Instead, I’m also switching from Wordpress to “something else”.</p>
<p>Think about it this way:<br>The emptier this place gets, the closer <a href="https://cssence.com/">cssence.com</a> gets to <strong>lights on.</strong> 😉</p>
<h2>Updating the update</h2>
<p><time id="update-1" class="update" datetime="2015-10-02">October 2, 2015:</time> You are reading this on cssence.com, hence the transition is complete. 🚀</p>
