<p>This page contained a list of all the <em>Access Keys</em> used on this site, but as they are causing more harm than they help I have removed them. Which is why this page will get a new purpose.</p>
<h2>Accessibility Statement</h2>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/an-accessibility-statement/">Ethan Marcotte’s Accessibility Statement</a>, I’d like to add one right here. Watch out for upcoming changes. In a nutshell: Making websites accessible is part of my job, hence I’d also like my private site to be as accessible as possible. While I do my best to ensure that, time is limited, as are my testing capabilities. If you encounter any issues, please let me know by sending an e-mail to <strong>accessibility at this domain</strong>.</p>
