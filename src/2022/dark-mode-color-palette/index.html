<p>Thanks to all the work that went into <a href="/2021/beyond-100vw/">the latest redesign</a> of this site, adding Dark Mode was rather easy. Colors were already neatly stored in CSS custom properties, so all I had to do was to actually redefine them for visitors that have a certain preference<sup><a id="ref-fn-1" href="#fn-1" role="doc-noteref" aria-label="Footnote #1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I tried out some colors, and was already quite happy. But then I remembered that I also wanted reduce the brightness for images, like so.</p>

<p>The thing is, more often than not, some of the colors used on my site make a cameo appearance in article images, especially in the article thumbnails. I concluded, if <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements get the filter applied, I should adjust the colors for dark mode in the exact same way, so they still match. Creating <a href="https://codepen.io/cssence/pen/MWOzaYP">a CodePen to do just that</a> saved me a trip to an image editor, because I can pour in the light mode colors, apply the filter, and then pick the colors based on what is shown on screen. As a bonus, to create a thumbnail for this article, I simply made a screenshot of the color palette.</p>

<p>I know this does not count as reverse-engineering Dark Mode, but I’m going with it anyway.<br><a href="/2022/dark-mode-color-palette/">cssence.com/2022/dark-mode-color-palette</a></p>
