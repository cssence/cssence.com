<p>Joined Mastodon on a whim. Now I need to find the time to update my personal site, so that certain links no longer point to Twitter. I may have anticipated that move three years ago, when I wrote <a href="/2019/leaving-social-sites/">cssence.com/2019/leaving-social-sites</a>.<br>#TwitterMigration</p>

<p>#introduction 👋<br>I’m a web developer with focus on semantic #HTML and #A11Y. I’m from Austria, working in Vienna. I’m into #CSS since its early days. On the previous platform I only t***ted about web development stuff, which I will continue to do here. So I guess I’ll never run into the need to set a content warning. But I anyhow prefer to post on my #blog cssence.com, which has no character limit.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot. 😊<br>I have a blog post about that, which needless to say is still in draft. But I wrote <a href="/2021/beyond-100vw/">cssence.com/2021/beyond-100vw</a> to explain why I took a certain risk when it comes to mobile devices, which was a main reason this redesign didn’t take forever.</p>

<p>Goes without saying, I’ve joined Mastodon because of what has happened to you over in bird town. 😶</p>
