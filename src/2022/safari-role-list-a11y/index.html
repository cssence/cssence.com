<h1>Safari vs. Unstyled Lists</h1>
<p>Is the <code>role="list"</code> workaround still needed?</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://twitter.com/hdv/status/1576187757424263173">Hidde de Vries asked:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you could fix 3 bugs in assistive tech or browsers, to make building accessible UI components more straightforward, what would they be?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two &amp; three took me a while, but the first issue that came to my mind was the need to add <code>role="list"</code> to unstyled lists in Safari, because they otherwise lose their semantics and are announced as plain text in VoiceOver. Apparently, I was <a href="https://twitter.com/_jamesbateson/status/1576213506432860162">not the only one.</a></p>
<p>For those who want to learn more about the issue, it occurs on lists that have their bullets or other indicators removed, e.g. with <code>list-style: none</code>, which can be quite a few. I found out about this years ago when reading <a href="https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/01/12/lists-and-safari.html"><em>‚ÄúFixing‚Äù Lists</em> by Scott O‚ÄôHara.</a> As he mentions in his article, the issue goes back to at least 2017, when <a href="https://gerardkcohen.me/writing/2017/voiceover-list-style-type.html">Gerard K. Cohen first wrote about it,</a> but it is probably with us since forever.</p>
<p>While it sure is a minor issue, one that can be solved with <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/17690">a little bit of otherwise unnecessary code,</a> it is one that bugs me the most on my own site. To add insult to injury, if you run code with these fixes applied through an HTML validator, it will happily tell you there is no need to add <code>role="list"</code> to lists, because the role is implied.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>All this made me wonder if this was still a thing in the latest version of Safari. To find out, I‚Äôve created a CodePen that allows me to quickly test it myself. Sure enough, the bug is still there in Safari 15. Here‚Äôs hoping that future me will be able to come back to this article and add an update stating the issue has been resolved.</p>

<p>The problem with this bug is, that the Safari engineers don‚Äôt understand as such. It works as THEY intended. As always. Apple engineers and designers know best. üôÇ<br>I don‚Äôt think that the bug will be fixed in the next five or ten years.</p>

<p>You may be right about no-fix-anytime-soon.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm willing to give Safari a break, initially it solved a problem, and other browers did similar things (see <a href="/2020/voiceover-table-issue/">tables</a>). But as we are seeing things being fixed in other browsers, Safari is running out of excuses.</p>

<p>In this point in my view Apple never had an excuse.<br>On the other hand: if Apple is right in this point and their customers love to have no clue about the number of navigation entries, then they have every right to be in the dark and we shouldn‚Äôt help them.<br>But how can we tell?</p>

<p>This likely dates back to the attempt of fixing wrongdoings from the web‚Äôs early days (tables for layout, etc.), which surely was hard. But today, I‚Äôd rather fix the bug at the risk of breaking questionable backwards-compatibility for ancient sites, and help #a11y instead.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks to our conversation, I found this gem from 2011 by <a href="https://twitter.com/rogerjohansson">@rogerjohansson</a>, a great read:<br><a href="https://456bereastreet.com/archive/201111/screen_readers_and_css/">456bereastreet.com/archive/201111/screen_readers_and_css</a></p>
