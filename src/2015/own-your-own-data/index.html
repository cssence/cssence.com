<h2>Host your data on your own site</h2>
<p>Why? Because your data belongs to you. Not to third parties with their rules, subject to change, whenever and however they see fit.</p>
<p>That being said, this does not mean your data needs to remain only at your place. You can syndicate the data to those third party sites.</p>
<h2>Migration of data</h2>
<p>In my case, hosting my own data is still a work in progress. I started with my blog posts and a bunch of other things. In September 2017 <a href="/code/">my code snippets</a>&#x200a;—&#x200a;until then only to be found on CodePen&#x200a;—&#x200a;finally came home. Now it is only a matter of time until the stuff I <a href="https://twitter.com/cssence">tweeted</a> before 2016 joins in.<ins><sup><a href="#update-1">[1]</a></sup></ins></p>

<h2 id="updates">Update</h2>
<p><time id="update-1" class="update" datetime="2019-11-23">November 23, 2019:</time> Everything I’ve tweeted since joining Twitter in <a href="/2010/">2010</a> is now available on this domain too. All that remains to be done is to copy some replies I’ve posted on medium.com.</p>
<p><time id="update-2" class="update" datetime="2021-11-25">November 21, 2021:</time> Said replies I’ve posted on medium.com are now on my own site a well, so the transition is complete.</p>
