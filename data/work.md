# Portfolio
^ Coming soon?

There is this [this tweet](https://twitter.com/jmspool/status/793837434207367168) by [Jared Spool](https://twitter.com/jmspool):

Well, this developer doesn’t have one either (yet). Although there is loads of stuff to put in a portfolio, there hasn’t been time to do so. If you are reading this now, apparently little has changed.
