# About This Site
^ CSSence dot com

## Definition

The term **CSSence** is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) coined by blending the abbreviation for _Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)_ and the word _essence_. By adding the top level domain (TLD) <tt>.com</tt> you get the URL for the site you are looking at. However, the TLD is misleading, because there is nothing commercial here. Also, no advertisement. You are welcome.

## Knowing the history

In 2011, it all started with a blog on Wordpress. This [no longer existing predecessor](https://web.archive.org/web/20130331131047/http://cssence.wordpress.com) came with the tagline <q>The Essence of <abbr>CSS</abbr></q>. If you look closely, the tagline is still alive and well, but remains hidden most of the time.

The blog was conceived as&#x200a;—&#x200a;and I am quoting my old site here&#x200a;—&#x200a;

> […] an online magazine about CSS, [which] brings you a fresh article every month, filled with a vast amount of CSS goodness.

Guess what happened. One article per month. That even worked for a little while, as enough ideas came to my mind, simply by working full-time on web projects. Although back then this translated to spending 85% of said full time in Internet Explorer. At some point however, I was no longer fast enough writing the ideas down because my attention was needed elsewhere. In hindsight, there always are a lot of elsewheres.

## Growing up

Anyway, since the beginning I’ve been blogging about web design and development, and I continued to do so [after I got my own domain](https://web.archive.org/web/20130831100511/http://www.cssence.com/). With the 2015 relaunch, the site evolved to serve as my personal hub, as you can tell by looking at the home page. Paired with the [fresh look](/2016/redesign/) it received in 2016 you’ll end up with what you are looking at today.

<figure class="standoff"><img src="/about/logo.png" alt="Logo of CSSence.com, an amalgam of the lowercase letters ‘c’ and ‘e’."><figcaption>Off-center logo with the color <code>#d34b6c</code> for the 45°&nbsp;bar. The color became the default when switching to a flat design in 2014.</figcaption></figure>

Give it some time and it will evolve again because I would like to bring home all the content I published elsewhere. I want to help to keep the decentralized web alive. You too should [own your own data](/2015/own-your-own-data/).

In addition, **CSSence** expanded to become my personal brand, I use this handle as my online identity for All Things Web, from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cssence) to [GitHub](https://github.com/cssence/) and everything in between.

Needless to say, this site is curated by me as I’m the main author. I’ve written everything you can find here, unless stated otherwise.
