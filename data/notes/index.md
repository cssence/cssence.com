# <del>Notes</del> Thoughts
^ Opinions, Conversations and Links

Whenever I feel the need to constrain my thoughts to a certain number of characters, it ends up here.
Sometimes these thoughts are uttered **opinions,** sometimes just **bookmarks** for my future self.
No matter what, they might even spark a conversation.
