^ The popularity contest on CSSence.com

Why not do rankings? Here are the [most read](#most-read) and the [most controversial](#most-controversial) posts from this site; and also some of [my favorites.](#featured)

<style media="screen">.posts li::before{position:absolute;left:5rem;top:0;line-height:1}
.posts li:nth-child(1)::before{content:"ðŸ¥‡"}

.posts li:nth-child(3)::before{content:"ðŸ¥‰"}
