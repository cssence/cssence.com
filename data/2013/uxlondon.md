# UX London
^ Greenwich, 2013

Instead of attending another development-focused conference I went to **UX London**. And the variety of topics presented was genuinely fascinating, as you can tell by [this line-up](http://2013.uxlondon.com/).

On top of that, this year they switched to another venue. Great choice by the way.
