# Goodbye Wordpress

## Important update: cssence is moving

cssence is moving to its own domain cssence.com, I expect everything to be back online by the end of April.

In the meantime I’ve posted this message, so you (and Google, Bing, etc.) can get your bookmarks updated.

Although it seems as if articles already got lost, I assure you this is not what happened. I’m removing article by article from cssence.wordpress.com, starting with the newest. However, they do not yet show up at the new place. Honestly, I didn’t think it would take this long, but I’m not just moving content – as it would be the case with a _wordpress.com to wordpress.org_ transition. Instead, I’m also switching from Wordpress to “something else”.

Think about it this way:  
The emptier this place gets, the closer [cssence.com](https://cssence.com/) gets to **lights on.** 😉

## Updating the update

<time id="update-1" class="update" datetime="2015-10-02">October 2, 2015:</time> You are reading this on cssence.com, hence the transition is complete. 🚀
