# An Event Apart
^ Seattle, 2012

For my first ever web conference, I had to go across the pond, all the way to Seattle. Not only have I been blessed with two days of great talks, followed by a full-day workshop with Luke Wroblewski, I also met web legends Jeffrey Zeldman and Eric Meyer. No surprise though, _An Event Apart_ happens to be their creation.
