# UX London
^ Greenwich, 2014

After [last year’s experience](/2013/uxlondon/) I am more than thrilled to be able to return to **UX London** for yet another [great conference](http://2014.uxlondon.com/).

I’m also glad they kept the venue, UX London once again takes place in the somehow extremely well-fitting [Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music &amp; Dance](https://www.trinitylaban.ac.uk/).
