^ @dotCSS 2016

<abbr title="Question">Q:</abbr> What happens to be the largest CSS conference in Europe?  
<abbr title="Answer">A:</abbr> [dotCSS](https://www.dotcss.io/)!

Being part of the [dotConferences series](https://www.dotconferences.com/), they are applying the [TED-Talk](https://www.ted.com/) format to development conferences, and by doing so they are rather different.

<h2 id="talks">Speakers</h2>

The length of each talk is limited to 18&nbsp;minutes, but if you look at the incredible [line-up](https://2016.dotcss.io/), you’ll know that this did not stop the speakers from delivering amazing insights (and some live coding as well).

<h3 id="talks-lightning">Lightning Talks</h3>

In addition, there has been something I have not seen at other conferences so far. Participants of dotConferences are invited to submit talk proposals; the chosen ones will get 4&nbsp;minutes on stage to present their so-called _Lightning Talk_. Yours truly happened to be among them.
