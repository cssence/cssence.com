# SVG currentColor

Color transitions on SVG paths can be tricky, as browsers behave differently when it comes to transition property `color` and `fill`. Especially when `currentColor` is involved.

This was something I would have needed for the navigation on this site, but I ran into browser issues. In the end I used a slightly different solution and specified a handful of actual color values instead of using the `currentColor` shortcut. But I made this pen to check if browser behavior changes over time.
