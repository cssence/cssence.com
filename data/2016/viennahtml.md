## Metadata

I had to send some information about me and my talk to the organizer, which I did.

> **Summary:**  
> It’s a brave new world of static site generators out there. So why would you write your own when this is your competition? We’ll look into the pros and cons. And pitfalls.
>
> **Bio:**  
> Matthias Beitl gets paid for technical consulting, which tends to be rather fuzzy.
> To combat this, he manages to sneak in some tangible web development whenever possible.
> He really likes the web, his first site went online in 1998, at a time when having a tilde in the URL was the norm. IRL hobbies include coffee and ducks, in that order.
