# We Are Web Clerks
^ @WeAreWebClerks Vienna 2019

I’ve been attending the first-ever [WeAreWebClerks Community Conference 2019](https://webclerks.at/) in Vienna. Glad to see one of the most livable cities finally has a down-to-earth (read: not ReactJS-and-the-likes) web developer conference.

<h2 id="talks">Talks &amp; Speakers</h2>

- “Building” by [Jeremy Keith](https://twitter.com/adactio)
- “Dark UX patterns” by [Lisa Gringl](https://twitter.com/kringal)
- “Rage Against the Content Machine” by [Max Böck](https://twitter.com/mxbck)
- “Why Every Interface Should Be Black & White” by [Heydon Pickering](https://twitter.com/heydonworks)
- “Stakeholder-Centric Design” by [Che Harvey](https://twitter.com/chebydesign)
- “Does It Work? Using The New CSS Layout” by [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew)

During lunch break, I’ve also been attending these two Lightning Talks:
