Otherwise I most likely would have ended up tinkering around forever. Instead, I just called it <em>Beta</em> and went live. [cssence.com]((https://cssence.com/)"

    text: "But the point is, and I’m paraphrasing “Just Write” by [@SaraSoueidan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan): “Just Launch.” As long as it is accessible, you can put it out there.<br>[sarasoueidan.com/desk/just-write/](https://sarasoueidan.com/desk/just-write/)<br><br>P.S. A proper long-form blog post about all the CSS trickery that went into the redesign will follow."
