## Accessibility Statement

Inspired by [Ethan Marcotte’s Accessibility Statement](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/an-accessibility-statement/), I’d like to add one right here. Watch out for upcoming changes. In a nutshell: Making websites accessible is part of my job, hence I’d also like my private site to be as accessible as possible. While I do my best to ensure that, time is limited, as are my testing capabilities. If you encounter any issues, please let me know by sending an e-mail to **accessibility at this domain**.
