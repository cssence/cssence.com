    text: "[@mmatuzo](https://twitter.com/mmatuzo)<br>All of the above. 🙂<br>Chronological listings (e.g. entries shown under “Most recent” on the home page) have them included, but I also have a dedicated “Articles” section, where I list long-form blog post types, so basically everything except “Notes”.<br>[cssence.com/articles](/articles)"
