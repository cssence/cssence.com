    text: "[@studiochris](https://twitter.com/studiochris)<br>Congrats, Chris! 🙌😄 It was the same with my first site. I did not post new stuff for almost five years… 🙈<br>Don’t be too hard on yourself. But if you try to make it a habit to regularly write just a little bit, you’ll end up posting more often. And it’s worth it!"
