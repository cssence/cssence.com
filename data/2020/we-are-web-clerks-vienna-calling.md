# We Are Web Clerks
^ @WeAreWebClerks @CssVienna #ViennaCalling Meetup 2020

After last year‚Äôs first-ever [WeAreWebClerks Community Conference](/2019/we-are-web-clerks), [@wearewebclerks](https://twitter.com/wearewebclerks) teamed up with [@CssVienna](https://twitter.com/CssVienna) and delivered the [#ViennaCalling meetup](https://webclerks.at/vienna-calling/) straight to our homes via Twitch. I‚Äôve been truly impressed. I would not have had the time to attend the meetup on location, but thanks to the current virtual-only-ness the world is going through, I‚Äôve been able to join the [live stream.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/694348922) Similarly, the line-up would have been different too, because these great speakers might not have able to visit Vienna ‚Äújust‚Äù for a meetup.

But let‚Äôs face it, with such amazing talks it felt like an actual conference. Or, as [Max B√∂ck put it,](https://twitter.com/mxbck/status/1288034544805871616) <q>This is not your grandma‚Äôs meetup.</q>
