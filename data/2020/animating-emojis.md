# Animating Emojis
^ Another Unicode Adventure

This might become a yearly tradition, even though so far it only happened once before. Last year I tampered with [Neutral Face.](/2019/animating-emojis)

This year it is all about monkeys. Our main character is the see no evil monkey. According to [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/see-no-evil-monkey/), 🙈 is &hellip;

> [&hellip;] called <span lang="ja-JP">Mizaru</span> (Japanese for “see not”), one of the Three Wise Monkeys. Depicted as the brown 🐵 Monkey Face with tan or pinkish hands covering its eyes.

It appears as if the monkey is playing [peekaboo.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peekaboo) Also, I put the monkey behind a wall (that looks a lot like the one from _Super Mario_), but I am not sure if this was a good idea, because depending on the emoji set on your operating system, the wall might be covering too little or too much.

Peekaboo! I see you!
