# Re: Design
^ A Three Part Blog Series.

This is a <strong id="3-part-blog-series">Three Part Blog Series.</strong> Although the focus of this Editorial series is an in-depth look at the [latest redesign of this site](/2019/just-launch), you may read these posts as letters of appreciation to the [Basics of the Web.](/2016/webdesign-basics) I wrote these parts by importance, most important first.
