# CSS&nbsp;Day UX&nbsp;Special
^ @CSSDayConf 2018 Day #1

I was in Amsterdam, attending the [CSS Day conference](https://cssday.nl/2018) for the second time. While the actual [CSS Day](/2018/cssday/) took place on Friday, they once again added a special on Thursday. When I was there [two years ago](/2016/cssday-htmlspecial/) it was about **HTML**, the year before I missed out on **Browser APIs**, but in 2018 all eyes were on **User Experience (UX).**
