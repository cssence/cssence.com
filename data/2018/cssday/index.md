# CSS Day
^ @CSSDayConf 2018 Day #2

Why wouldn‚Äôt you want to learn about CSS in Amsterdam? As if the [UX&nbsp;Special](/2018/cssday-uxspecial/) the day before wasn‚Äôt already crazy good, the line-up for the actual [CSS&nbsp;Day](https://cssday.nl/2018) has been phenomenal. And by the end of the day I‚Äôve learned a lot.
