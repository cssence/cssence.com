# Welcome to CSSence.com
^ Hello, I’m <span aria-label="@CSSence."><abbr>css</abbr>ence</span>

<h2 id="introduction" class="visually-hidden">CSSence? What is that?</h2>

<section><h3 id="cssence-the-person">The Person</h3>

My name is Matthias, I’m also known as @CSSence. I’m a web developer, passionate about design, semantics and accessibility. And obviously CSS. I work in Vienna, Austria.

<section><h3 id="cssence-the-website">The Website</h3>

This site started as a weblog on Wordpress. As time went by, I&nbsp;got my own domain and turned it into a full-fledged IndieWeb hub, where all my content resides for longevity.
